0,1.0,Greasy,It boasts that it‚Äôs made of all natural products but I ordered a number of its products and I‚Äôve been very disappointed with all of them. This scrub is very greasy and I have to wash my face with something after using it.,B071LHHKQQ,All_Beauty

2,1.0,Did Not Fit My Revlon or Conair Blow Dryers,"The item arrived in a timely manner. One star because it fits neither one of my blow dryers. The blow dryer it fits FOR SURE should be listed. I saw the Babyliss I think that's the correct name of that dryer listed as a package deal, but has anyone tried to attach this attachment with success. So right now it's useless to me. Don't think you should have to resort to duct tape as some have done and the Solia that it might fit is expensive. Still it would be wasting more money if the Solia doesn't fit. There are probably different models of the Solia. It would be helpful if someone would list the EXACT model and name that they attached it to.",B008A12F36,All_Beauty

I used this along with a natural blemish face wash to make sure my skin was clean before application. I also used foundation with sunscreen (SPF 15) to protect my skin during the day.<br /><br />My outfit in the green is 1 month after daily use.

58,1.0,Don‚Äôt waste your money.,"Don‚Äôt do it! Heed the warnings of those that have gone before you. There is a reason why this kit can not be returned and it‚Äôs not because contents are flammable üòí The dip was great, the box was cute, the two bottles are small (but that is stated on the advertisement.) So what is the issue? You get halfway through... your manicure is looking awesome, then (like many other reviewers have stated) the Double duty gel applicator gels up and stops working. When I read that others had this issue- I assumed it was user error and that they left the applicator brush out while doing other steps. Nope. Wrong. Once you open the gel bottle, you have about 6 minutes to complete your manicure on all 10 nails before the gel turns into globby super glue and your brush gets so stiff that you are better off applying the coat with your finger... because that would poly more smoothly than the applicator. Super disappointing. I have one hand with a wonderful manicure and the other with semi-salvaged manicure job thanks to a lot of filing (but it‚Äôs obvious that the layers were applied with a brush that streaked on the gel.) Revel should really just include a replacement applicator brush with these kits. This was my first time trying their products and it will honestly be my last.",B08NC3M3DB,All_Beauty

This stuff is EXTREMELY difficult to apply to your hair. It's one step away from being a actual candle. That's how much wax is in here.

122,2.0,Dissapointed,"I bought this to replace a Norelco 6848XL (about 10 years old?) that has worked well, but is beginning to have poor battery life.  This new 8140XL appears to me to be cheaply built, to the point that I find myself still leaning towards using the older model.  In more detail, the cutting heads are slightly larger on the 8140, but much less smooth (even painful to an extent) than the older model.  Also, the cutting head is held on to the 8140 by a very sloppy connection and falls off very easily when you are trying to clean it.  The whole general construction of the 8140 seems to much less ""solid"" than the older 6848.<br /><br />In short, Norelco seems to have gone towards cheaper cosnstruction in an attempt to save on costs (and yes, to be able to offer the 8140 at a ""low"" cost to the consumer).  However, this consumer is not impressed.  In hindsight, I should have instead sent the 6848 in for new batteries.",B0009MFUOA,All_Beauty

152,2.0,"best shave with no irritation, 6 months later disaster hit","Review #1 I bought this razor for myself this xmas, and I cant believe i wasted my time shaving with expensive blades for all these years. I have ridiculously sensitive skin and this shaver cured that problem. I use this razor after a hot shower with a non foaming shaving cream. this is the closest shave I've ever had. I used to shave with your typical stick razor with three blades twice/week to avoid irritation, but now i shave every other day and I never get razor burn or any discomfort.<br /><br />Forget the expensive stick razors and other electrics. This travel shaver is the way to go. It does take a little longer than your triple bladed mach 3, but if u have skin like mine, its worth the extra 2 minutes to shave pain free. The sideburn trimmer is very powerful and accurate too. Carrying case was a great bonus.<br /><br />Review #2 After 6 months of use the shaver still worked as if I had purchased it yesterday. Unfortunately I had to switch back to shaving with a razor. I had a major problem with ingrown hairs under the chin and in the neck area. It was a real disappointment. I think the foil was giving me acne also. As soon as I stopped using this travel shaver the acne went away. I cleaned this thing religiously after each use so I'm not sure what the deal is.

162,2.0,Not as good as the old Advantage,"I'm a long-time blade shaver, but every 3-4 years I go on an electric shaver kick and use it for about a year.  I've never found a single electric razor that shaves as close as a blade, but I used to own a Norelco Advantage that gave a decently close shave that was pretty comfortable and didn't irritate my neck.<br /><br />This is supposed to be the upgrade to the Advantage, but after just a few days of use my neck is chewed up far worse than it ever has been with any other electric.  It's annoying enough that I'm not willing to ""wait it out"" for the 30-day trial period that Norelco recommends, and I'll be returning it next week.<br /><br />That being said, I can see from the other ratings that many people have had a lot of success with this shaver.  Part of my problem may be that I'm a shaving perfectionist and if I'm not getting a close shave in a given area I'll go over it again a few times until the hairs are cut off.  It boggles my mind that I can run an electric shaver over a patch of stubble and the stubble will sit there, unaffected, as if nothing at all had happened.  You don't see that happening with blades...<br /><br />So in summary:<br />Pros: auto-filling lotion cartridge, waterproof, quick charging, does glide well over face (no irritation WHILE shaving, but boy you'll feel it later)<br />Cons: seems to cause ingrown hairs at a higher rate than its predecessors, very high neck irritation, lotion seems to drip off of razor head while shaving, not a very close shave.  NO ELECTRIC IS EVER AS CLOSE AS A BLADE, so I wish that Norelco and Braun would stop claiming such.",B000UJZIEY,All_Beauty

They will just make you nauseous or trigger a headache.<br /><br />I have used the classic Oral B electric brush for many years. A fantastic simple white design by Braun of Germany - since discontinued after Braun was bought by an American company. Now I have the simple low end non pulsing model. Essentially the same guts and head as the classic but with an ugly, over stylized, blue body.<br /><br />When the battery started to die on my classic model, I picked up a pulsating Oral B. It is really banging away at your teeth and does as good a job as the non pulsatinging. But it vibrates your jaw and skull like, well, a vibrating electric tooth brush! After a month, it was just too much for me. I went back to the dieing battery original, but soon got its replacement as a gift.<br /><br />The verdict: I'm in my 40s and I've had about 6 different dentists (moving from job to job) in 5 different states. One was a professor at a dental college. After each visit, they all proclaim my teeth are in excellent shape. I use the cheapest Oral B electric brush (non pulsating) in the morning and before bed with Colgate Total. I also floss just one time before bed and use the Crest rinse for night time.

171,2.0,I don‚Äôt do silicones (and petrolatum),"I heard a lot of good things about this brand but after trying it / seeing the ingredients list I wasn‚Äôt too happy. My favorite is the moisture essence with 100% plant based squalane. It doesn‚Äôt have anything else and that is the only product I don‚Äôt mind using on my skin. It doesn‚Äôt have any offensive scents and odors, and I like the way it makes my skin feel. That product is 5 stars for me. However, the other two, Skin Refiner and Moisture Boost, I am not sold on because of the ingredients. When I first used the skin refiner I loved how it felt - goes on smoothly, glides through my skin, and melts into it like butter. I looked at the ingredients only to see that it is, of course, filled with silicone (siloxane and petrolatum). I should have looked at it first before trying. I know studies may have shown that silicones are ok for skin, but for me personally I just don‚Äôt want that on my face. As for the petrolatum, that is something I just don‚Äôt want anywhere near my skin! While I loved the way it felt I didn‚Äôt feel good about the stuff in it. The skin refiner also made my skin itchy and tingly, even though I tried on three separate occasions, so I had to stop using it. The good thing about these products is they are fragrance free. Overall, I just did not like the two out of three items. I posted a list of the ingredients for anyone who needs to refer to it.",B08S1LWF9V,All_Beauty
172,2.0,Weak sticks,"These cotton swabs have pushed the limit of lowering quality beyond what I can accept.  The length of these swabs is 1/8"" shorter than the traditional size, though it's got about the same amount of cotton as most Chinese swabs.  There's still about four out of a hundred that will snap due to wood grain weakness, but I understand that's inherent in the wood, itself, as wood is a natural product and has inconsistencies that you need to accept if you're going to use the product.  The problem with these swabs is that they come on a wooden stick the thickness of which is a whole, new low.  I've been using cotton swabs on wooden sticks for three decades and I've never before met wooden sticks this thin and weak before.  With these swabs you've got a high risk of breakage even with the sticks that don't have wood grain issues simply because of how thin and weak they've made the sticks.  If you only intend to use swabs for extremely light pressure work these are fine, but they can't handle the pressure of normal or average tasks.  They've skimpped on quality a little too much for me to recommend this product.  I would not buy them again.",B07JCQPSLR,All_Beauty
173,2.0,Too feature ridden.,"Ok I took note of the reviews and some issues folks had with this model and I still purchased it.  What is worse is even though I found that I disliked the same things as others I kept it, and only after the 60 day return did I decide I didn't really like it enough to use it.  So I am at fault, but I don't want others to make the same mistake.  The length setting is easily shifted while in use.  There is a plastic part near the blades which moves up and down when pressed against your face, why not just have it stationary?  I removed the plastic piece and then when I went without it I got the 5 o'clock look when I set it on a 3 which is odd.  The vacuum does work well (when in turbo mode) but I really didn't need it.  I donated it to the veterans, and I hope they get some use out of it.  I then went to target and for 25 dollars (10 less) I purchased the remington mb-300, which is much like the old norelco I had but better in several ways.

175,2.0,Disappointing.,"This product is very disappointing.  Initially I was excited to find a non-peel nail polish that was water based - I'm allergic to harsh chemicals, so traditional nail polish isn't an option.  I've used Suncoat peelable nail polish before and liked it a lot because it was completely odor free and did not cause any allergic reaction.  It did not last long on my nails, but I figured it was essentially meant for kids, so it's OK it if only lasts for a few hours.  I was only wearing it out for dinner, etc.  Then I've found out that Suncoat also makes water based polish that is non-peel.  I figured I would give it a try.  I've read multiple reviews stating that with proper application the product would last a few days on the nails.  2 or 3 days of wear are more than enough for me as I like to change my colors often.  Also, I understand that water based polish would never be as durable as the traditional polish, so I was perfectly OK to change it out every couple of days.  As soon as the product arrived I applied it as instructed. I did it shortly before bed time so that I wouldn't get my nails wet and allow the polish to cure.  By the time I woke up it had already chipped!  So, I reapplied and went to work.  By the time I got to work it was chipped again!  This was embarrassing; I spent good 20 minutes trying to scrap the polish off my nails.  Luckily, it came off easily.<br /><br />What's even more disappointing is that Suncoat customer service does not seem to care about customers.  I've contacted them asking if they had any helpful advice and so far received no response.",B016V28NQI,All_Beauty

225,3.0,"bristles on small brush are not lined up with exit spaces on barrel, rendering it barely effective","This product does work... it gets hot enough (to burn my scalp if I'm not careful), and does volumize and curl my fairly short (mid neck length) hair.  Due to my hair length, I needed a smaller diameter brush.  The negatives - gets very hot with small brush, which I kind of like, but the controls for this are a rotating ring on the base of the handle, very hard to figure which way I'm going to change temp and air flow.  Next and the main reason I am unhappy with it, is the bristles for the small diameter brush are not lined up with the spaces in the brush barrel and do not stick straight out, and therefore, do not catch my (very fine and straight) hair adequately.  I have similar brushes that have the same problem that I have had to throw away, and some that are absolutely excellent (see picture, this device on Left, bad bristles; Right awesome bristles on a fantastic brush).

But this gadget lets me take care of calluses myself quickly and easily, after a shower when my skin is soft. It works like a charm. However, there are no instructions and it will take you a little time to figure out how to use the shaver, how to use the rasp, and how to remove the blades (which need to be removed and cleaned after each use).

I was fresh my entire 12 hour shift. However, when I took a shower that night I noticed that a spot under my arm was very sensitive to touch. It was like a burning sensation. I thought maybe I had scrubbed too hard so I didn't apply the deodorant before I went to bed. The next morning I applied it and both of my arm pits were literally on FIRE! The pain was a 6/10 so I could not apply any kind of deodorant for several hours. I'm sure I had an allergic reaction, but I'm not sure if it was the fragrance or just the overall ingredients used in the deodorant. So I'm thinking it is probably just too harsh for sensitive skin.",B09XBSDCXP,All_Beauty

However my 3 star rating is because the powder brushes don't fit in the caddie due to being too long.When you put the top part in they get smashed. I wish it was just a couple inches taller to fit the longer ones because there isn't another area for them other than to lay them across stuff.

I saw that the reviews might have been fluffed but decided for the price it was worth a shot.  So far I think i really like it, it might even be worthy of five stars for the price. I actually ordered a second bottle of the other scent and will see how I like that.  The scent isnt bad, kinda beachy, its not great, just okay. The color however is nice. Before this i used paint it black and other variations of those cheap 13ounce brands on here. The only one that seemed to work okay was the tingle one and I hated seeing people I knew after the tanner, hugging them, then remembering I had to remind them their face might burn off in the next 20 minutes. So to save the embarrassment I decided to find a not tingle tanning lotion that worked to give me color.  This one clearly has bronzers because my nails and in between my fingers can get stained since I leave it on a few hours after the tanner.  I would say watch out for this, it can be a good thing and a bad thing, good because you know you will get color but bad because it can leave your hands sorta strange looking, its not as horrible as a sunless tanner product and shouldnt stain clothes but be aware of it.  The consistency is strange, seems high in silicone because when I apply it its like im rubbing lube all over me.  Not awful just a new texture from what im used to. It does spread easily tho which is nice and it seems to soak up pretty good too and not leave me super greasy.  Over all for the size and price I like it, the biggest downside is having to carry around such a large bottle every time i tan.  Will let you know how I like the other scent.",B00GDJTN3M,All_Beauty

As I said before, ''from a beginners point of view'' I would definitely recommend if you are looking for some solid trimmers at home (even though I seen countless vids of professional barbers utilizing) to give you a crisp line on your hair and beard.  Lightweight, compact, and cuts like a champ....packs power in such a small trimmer....(small to me because I do have bear paw hands)!

342,4.0,An interesting combination of scents,"[[ASIN:B000F5HADA Laura Mercier Almond Coconut Body & Bath Collection Souffle Body Creme 12 oz]] is hands down the best lotion I've ever purchased. As much I love the almond coconut scent, I was looking for a bit of a change.  I read a lot of positive reviews of the amber vanilla scent, and I decided to try it.  While I'm not a huge fan of vanilla (well, I love it as a food, but not so much as a beauty product!), I absolutely love amber-scented products.  As I'm writing this review, I'm sniffing the cream, and trying to find the best way to describe the scent.  It's not difficult to pick out the individual amber and vanilla aromas; it's the combination of the two that I'm having a hard time describing.  As different as the two scents are, they mix well together.  The slightly masculine amber keeps the vanilla from being overly sweet.  I would say that the amber scent is the more pronounced of the two.  This a strong scent; if you're looking for something subtle, you may want to consider another scent.<br /><br />The quality of Laura Mercier's cream is superb.

351,4.0,Something very odd,"As I wrote elsewhere regarding the Tweezerman brush, I think that I received the Simply Beautiful brush either as a substitute or by mistake. Given that I was charged the lower price of the Tweezerman, I have no complaints.<br /><br />I knew that something was odd when I opened the package and found a brush with a chrome instead of wooden handle. Honestly, I gave it no thought at the time and started using the brush the same day it arrived.<br /><br />Now I can't say that I've been using a shaving brush long enough to know the difference between a $20 brush and a $200 brush, but I can't imagine what such a price difference would buy in the way of ""real world"" performance. The materials are likely somewhat better in the more expensive brush and, I would hope, the assembly would be superb compared to the cheaper one. Yet, I somehow couldn't bring myself to spend even $50 on a brush unless I would have gotten some guaranty of superior performance.<br /><br />With that said, this brush absorbs plenty of water and, after a good shake, really whips up a nice lather. It's a bit ""prickly"" on my face which may be a sign of lower quality badger fur, but it certainly isn't uncomfortable.<br /><br />If  you're just starting to wet-shave, you could spend a lot more money and probably not get a brush that's appreciably better than this one. Oh, I'll eventually try one of the more expensive brushes as that's just my nature, but I doubt that I'll be getting a lot more for my money than I've gotten from this brush.",B0045QGYNM,All_Beauty

367,4.0,"The good, the bad and the ugly...","My review consists of the good, the bad and the ugly. First,<br />the good - I finally found a curler that 'fits' my eyelid. Huh, you say? Well, it appears that most of the manufacturers believe I have golf balls instead of human eyes. The tool's shape is long and shallow enough of a curve to catch most of the eyelashes. It is comfortable to use, but takes a bit of practice. Once you are comfortable with the scissor motion (sorry, no other way to describe it) used to make the curl, you are rewarded with a nice, non-crimpy curl. The pad in this one is the best I have used. This tool also opens wide enough that even the most nearsighted or lush lashed amoungst us can get it close to the base of the upper lashes. The design over all is very well thought out. I recommend using an magnifying mirror if you have to use bifocals (I do). All that said, now...<br />the bad - there is no replacement pad and I am questioning how sanitary this is going to be in the long run. I agree completely with folks here who advise to REMOVE ALL EYE MAKEUP before use. Ain't nothing pretty about an eye infection. I am wondering out loud how to properly clean this curler to be certain it remains safe. If you are prone to sties and other types of infection, I would be asking the same questions. Which leads to...<br />the ugly - until you practice and are used to it (won't take long) the results are a bit odd looking. The black pad is plushier and looks to be made of silicone and not the usual hard rubber. I have found that the hard rubber pads are chiefly responsible for that weird ugly crimp you can get. Not so with this one. I mentioned before the squeezy scissor action your thumb and index finger have to use can be tricky. If you have coordination issues, well - things could get ugly.<br />SUGGESTIONS for use...wash your hands before use. I keep the little plastic clip to keep the tool closed. You could follow the advise of one person here to heat the tool with a dryer, but I think I may skip that. Use a makeup mirror to assist you. Practice when you have some time. Enjoy, Ladies - get out there and be lovely.",B00JNI1DZQ,All_Beauty

372,4.0,Great shave from an electric....solution to annoying unplugging.,"This new Norelco Arcitec razor provides a great shave with little irritation.  I had a Braun Syncro previously, and it would leave little hairs everywhere on my neck.  This new designed head flexs and pivots in all different ways to have more contact with the skin.<br /><br />The jet clean station works good and is interesting to watch.  It does a good job of cleaning the razor heads of hair and debris.  There is however, one annoying issue.  Norelco says you should not charge the razor until it needs it to maximize battery life.  The jet clean system however, automatically goes into the charge cycle after cleaning and a two hour dry time!!  If your like me, you will probably be at work two hours after shaving.<br /><br />My solution to the unplugging is:<br /><br />I picked up a plug in rocker switch at Home Depot to go between the wall outlet and the Norelco Transformer plug.  I then shave a little earlier in my morning routine and clean the razor in the jet clean system.  I then turn the switch off while the system is in the 2 hour drying cycle.  This is ok since the razor is basically air/drip drying anyway.  If it needs charged, I turn the switch on while I know I'm going to be home for and hour then turn back off.  This is a bit annoying, but if I spent almost $200 on a razor then I want it to last.  You could also just unplug it during the drying mode, but I like the switch so I don't have plugs and cords everywhere.",B000PKMA2G,All_Beauty

374,4.0,Retinol Treatment,"Uptown Cosmeceuticals is a skin care brand focused on creating products without parabens, or artificial fragrance and colorants. Not all of the ingredients are organic, but use as many natural ingredients as possible, which may go against the health goals of some individuals and this product may not be strong enough to address problems like deep wrinkles and serious hyperpigmentation. It's doubtful that Uptown Cosmeceuticals products could ever produce effects similar to more aggressive treatments like microdermabrasion and laser skin therapy but when you factor in the low cost and the natural ingredients, it is well worth it to try. Regular use can reduce the appearance of blotched skin, blemishes, age spots and wrinkles. The serum is best used at night. The serum is so thick that I am unable to use the included applicator, but I don't think that's a bad thing. I have noticed slight skin brightening in just the few days that I have been using it. This is the 1st time I have ever used a product with retinol in it.<br /><br />I received this product in exchange for my honest review.

Goes on well and stays on fairly well. Evens out most of my skin tone, aside from a couple dark spots. Definitely works better over a primer than just over moisturizer, which isn't a huge issue for me. And patting it on, as the instructions state versus swirling it on does result in a fuller coverage and nicer finish.<br /><br />While in person it wasn't as blurred and flawless as a full makeup, it definitely was suitable for video calls or more casual days.<br /><br />I didn't notice any transfer, but I did have to touchup my chin and nose after a few hours, which was very easy to do (no problem with old over fresh not blending well)<br /><br />If feels very soft and light on my skin. Very comfortable. I almost forgot to take it off at the end of the day I first wore it, as it felt very natural.<br /><br />For my purposes, this worked exactly as I hoped.

The only problem I have is that the prices of BOB bars went from $9.99 to $19.99 which has completely gone out of my budget for essentials, so had to move to a different company (bottles).

They provide just the right amount of color pigmentation (that is extremely buildable), but do not dry your lips out AT ALL. In fact, since I started using these serums, my lips have stopped being flaky (which totally made using any kind of matte product impossible). Don‚Äôt be scared off by the deep colors in this set, they are both absolutely gorgeous on, and very flattering.

467,5.0,Total Lifesaver!,"My mom has bad psoriasis, and I mix this with neem/hops/marigold tinctures and cocoabutter into semi-hard discs, and it's helped clear up and soften many of the thick, rough, painful patches.<br /><br />For myself, I use it on painfully dry skin during the winter, and my feet whenever I've waited too long to get a pedicure, plus, this stuff's a miracle on busted cuticles like I get from doing dishes all the time.<br /><br />I will say it is an extremely soft butter, more like a jellified oil (which it basically is, since it's been dehydrated into a semi-solid), and it has a lot of 'slip'. If you're looking for a firmer butter, this isn't it, this is SUPREMELY soft stuff. Think grainy margarine (sounds gross, I know, but this stuff's just way too awesome). If you've got very dry hair, this also helps, but remember: a little goes a very long way with this stuff. It's a bit slow to absorb, which is why it's good for massage, and it's not as messy as a straight liquefied oil.",B006JALQW6,All_Beauty

612,2.0,No good for diving,"I bought my contour camera for capturing underwater video while diving. While the camera itself has performed awesome, this headband has not. When in its underwater housing, the camera is a little heavy and bulky. The headband is not stiff enough and it causes the camera to bob. Also because the housing makes the camera positively buoyant, the camera is easily caught by the current and the strap allows it to waggle.<br /><br />I have posted a video that was shot using the headband and illustrates the problem.<br /><br />http://theflyinglobster.blogspot.com/2013/04/3-topics-to-watch.html<br /><br />Right now, hand holding the camera using a GorillaPod as a stabilizing wand. I am considering a cave diving helmet so that I have a more stable surface or mounting the camera.<br /><br />For the record I have not used the headband with the camera without the housing.

It soaks up water super quickly and leaves wet fabric on you that is FREEZING when you get hit with a gust of air. (I have a small fan in my room and that is the culprit of the coldness) While the design is pretty and i liked the color more than i thought i would i just can see it as a practical or everyday item. The material while comfortable and silky when NOT wet, is extremely thin. Not to the point of being able to see through it but it would be better over clothes like a tank top or as a shawl to dress up an outfit sans sash.<br /><br />I used it literally 3 times and the seam on one of the corners is broken, no idea how because i put it on for a maximum of 10 minutes (realistically it was around 5 minutes) each time i used it and took it off immediately upon entering my room.<br /><br />Would've loved a slightly bigger size as i am a rounder curvy girl and it just didnt fall as loosely as I'd hoped. It did fit perfectly and covered all the goodies without fear of having an inpromtu show, I just prefer baggy clothing.<br /><br />All in all if the material was a little thicker and the seams reinforced I would definitely purchase it again just kind of bummed im out a robe that i barely got to use.",B074SKH9SS,Amazon_Fashion

714,3.0,Sturdy but has problems,"Eastpak Mastermind is quite a sturdy knapsack.<br />I use it to carry items to and from work.  It does a great job<br />in holding my lunch, books, folded jacket, notebooks, keys..etc.<br />Most sacks I've had don't handle the weight that well, especially if you are a college student.  I have actually had a knapsack rip apart at the seems under the weight off all the text books I'm carrying.  Eastpak doesn't have that problem.<br />Also wearing an Eastpak on your back is quite gentle.  The straps and backing are foam, so it's easy on the back and shoulders.  The knapsacks material is also pretty water repellent.  I've gone through more than my share of being stuck in the middle of a torrential downpour, the outside of my knapsack is soaked, but the contest were bone dry.<br />My only negative comment about Eastpak is the no-slip straps.<br />They should be called &quot;always-slip&quot;.  I've threaded the straps every which way and they've always come undone under the most light weight carrying conditions.  I've ended up knotting the end of the strap so it doesn't slip through.  Really not astetically pleasing, but it got the job done.  My only real issue with this fine bag.<br />For the college student on the go, or for the white collar worker rushing to and from work, I believe Eastpak is a good buy with some minor reservations.",B0000732QU,Amazon_Fashion

718,3.0,Different than I expected.,This item suited the needs of pleasing an 11 year old who is a big fan of the Hunger Games franchise. The price was reasonable. The necklace however was not even close to what was shown in the product photo. As you can see from the photo it was chunky and the mocking jay was placed differently. The thin bronze chain shown in the product photo was actually a thick silver colored chain. The whole item looked a little on the cheap side.,B00FYNM2LS,Amazon_Fashion

It fit perfectly, but I returned it for two reasons. First, the lace didn't look as high quality as in the picture; it looked really cheap and kind of reminded me of lace curtains that my grandma used to have. Second, in the picture, it appears as though the sleeves are separate pieces with their own elastic. In reality, they were all connected with one piece of elastic which made the shirt difficult to move around in.",B010N0235Q,Amazon_Fashion

You can't wear a bra with it, but it offers no support for anyone over a B cup. The only reason I didn't return it is because the seller made it difficult to do so. So, after re-sewing on the loops, I ended up wearing it to my engagement party. The pictures look good and I got many compliments on it, but I wouldn't wear it again.",B07CYJP5J6,Amazon_Fashion

797,3.0,Hoping for the best,"Received the chain yesterday.  It does come in a little cardboard box taped shut.  If bought as a gift, you'll need to get a better box or find another way to present it.  It was not all knotted up and does have a lobster claw clasp.  The chain is pretty, very delicate and lightweight, marked 14k.  I bought it to replace a broken chain for a crucifix necklace, and it will work.  But I won't wear it to bed, shower with it, etc.  Likely just a matter of time before I break it.  On the bright side, at least I know a 2mm chain is way too narrow.  For me, it's impossible to gauge how wide these chains are online, but now I have something to start with.",B01725KJE2,Amazon_Fashion

When looped twice it hangs/sits higher than I'd prefer, tho that might not be the case for women with smaller/flat chests.  Basically, when my phone is in the pocket, it's resting on my breast.

So many scarves terrible hems that are unraveled when you get them, but not this one! It's very color and soft. The only reason I didn't give it a five star, is because it's not a very large scarf and it ships from China, so it took about 5 weeks to get it.

Both were only small pads for the top/back part of the shoe. Neither stayed in place. These, with the extra bottom of heel area, make all the difference in keeping them in place.<br /><br />For some reason, one pad didn't stick as well (on the heal area) as the other. This could very well have been an issue on my end, and is why I gave only 4 stars.<br /><br />I used a Qtip to dab a little crazy glue in a couple spots to keep it in place.

I ordered 3-6 months for my baby and I'm afraid it wont fit until he's about 8-9 months old.<br />The material is soft and it's super adorable.

I would recommend sticking with the ladies Lish hosiery.  Perhaps they will add more colors in the future.

814,4.0,Great Leggings!,"These are dupes of the NVGTN forest green leggings and I have to say, for half the price, they are giving NVGTN a run for their money. They're not quite as compressive as the real deal, but other than that, they're the exact same things. The color, the fabric, the contour- everything.

823,4.0,Runs small but good quality shoe,"These are good bowling shoes for the kids bowl free program. They do run small as other reviewers have stated. My daughter is a 9.5 in shoes and has a wider foot and we had to order her an 11 for her to have some room at the toe. They will last the season and I will order these again the next year until she can get into the bsi sneaker like bowling shoes. She was very excited about the shoes and can take them on and off herself at 4 years old. If you aren't sure what size to order you can always try them on at the bowling alley to get an idea, that is how I discovered that in 10s she has her toe up at the top of the shoe. The shoes don't offer a lot of comfort for the little ones but they are only wearing them for 2 hours and I suppose you could put an insert in from an old pair of sneakers if they did have issues. Overall I am pleased with the quality of the shoes and just disappointed the sizing isn't right as well as the lack of padding which is why they lost a star. If you want the true size guarantee you need to purchase directly from bowling.com I believe it is an extra 6.00 which covers up to two exchanges and shipping to get the right sizing. I could not figure out how to purchase the true fit guarantee within Amazon.",B00A62TWTM,Amazon_Fashion
824,4.0,Good suit for long torso and full bust,"This is a good choice one-piece for a long torso; it also camouflages tummy bulge pretty well. Don't order if you are in a hurry to get it. It took a couple of weeks. It has not been beach-tested yet, so no idea how it will hold up with swimming, salt water, or laundering, but the material has a substantial feel and opacity.<br /><br />Follow up: I bought this for my daughter, and I had to take it in on the sides. Even though she had an ample bosom, the suit still gapped at the sides. With the tucks in place, the suit performed well in the ocean, sand, and sun. It is great for tummy control, but I don't recommend it for a smaller bust because of the gapping.",B01MXEZH9A,Amazon_Fashion

829,4.0,It has Pockets!,"I'm in love! This dress had few reviews when I ordered it, but it was advertised as a promising up and comer and I was in the market for a fall dress, so I decided to give it a shot. I'm so glad I did! I was a little nervous when I saw the elastic because unless said elastic is directly under my chest, it cuts directly across my torn muscles, which I do not enjoy advertising.  I was pleased to discover the elastic was under the chest and the cut off the dress was fabulous. I'm 5'2&#34;, 127 pounds, 34D chest for reference, and going off the sizing chart, I ordered a small. It fits perfectly. Being short, the only thing I was worried about was the length, but thanks to the cut off this dress, my height isn't an issue. My only real complaint is that the sleeves are too long, but that happens with almost every article of long sleeved clothing I buy. It's made of sturdy material that isn't cheap looking at all. I will absolutely be purchasing one in another color.",B07FXCZJXW,Amazon_Fashion
830,4.0,Great but the top is tight,I love these for walking in the rain when I don‚Äôt want to wear clunky rain boots. The only problem is the top is so tight that I can‚Äôt close them all the way. If you have extremely skinny ankles you will be fine!,B07Z44SNJW,Amazon_Fashion

I also had even more stuff in my bag as well. There's a front pocket that's also great for putting pens, markers, etc. Overall I think this is a great bag however I only bumped it down one star because the bottom of the bag is kinda thin so we'll see how long it lasts.

I am sure excited to pair this beauty with my brown boots and cream color scarf. I think I might even look for cute belt to wear with it. The elastic waist band fits comfortably. I wear a medium and I am pleased to say that the medium fits true to size in the top and sleeves. BUT I am 5.6 and I feel it is a little long on me. The bottom of the dress comes to mid calf for me. Wish it was just a tiny bit shorter. The sleeve are a good length. Pretty excited cause there aren't too many long sleeve dresses out there. The material feels soft and flowy.

863,4.0,Love the bird print,"The bird print fabric received tons of compliments.  The dress is definitely body con but the whimsicalness of the print balances that so it worked, even in my conservative corporate office. I wore it also for a graduation ceremony,  both times with flats. It has enough stretch to be comfortable but if you are a bustier gal you may find the girls are showing more than would be appropriate for certain settings. Those of us who are smaller (32-34A/24/36; 108lbs., 5'4&#34;) can appreciate the draping at the top which adds volume without being too exposing. Some cons: I do wish it had a zipper though -- it has to be pulled on over the head, which means for some wiggling. Don't do your hair or makeup or put on deodorant until after you pull this on. Also, the bird print is great but the fabric tends to crease during the day; however, because the top was already drapey/folded, it actually ended up looking almost like it was pleated,  as if it was supposed to be that way. It wrinkles after washing and must be line-dried so prepare to iron if you want it perfectly pressed. However, the bird print kind of hides the wrinkles-- it gives it texture without looking too &#34;crumpled&#34; so you could probably get away without ironing if that didn't bother you.",B06WWB6VTR,Amazon_Fashion

868,4.0,Wouldn't be bad it were the correct size.,"I received the DANNE MORA Women's Short Denim Jacket Casual Fashionable Cropped Black Trucker Jacket in the wrong size so I will do my best to review it fairly. Usually, Amazon gets it right when there are no size options to choose. This time I received a size large. For reference, I typically wear a size small or medium.<br /><br />I have a similar jacket in the correct size in blue denim, and it looks and fits great. Not many woven tops or jackets can accommodate the combination of narrow shoulders and a larger chest and look good. However, this style does.<br /><br />It fit as a size large should. I lost 40 lbs, so I do know. The quality is excellent, and the fabric has a bit of stretch. It falls just at my natural waist. For reference, I am 5'3"" and the length on the arms was just below my wrist bone. The distressed details are not overdone, and It would be a lovely jacket if it were my correct size.",B07PJ2DJRD,Amazon_Fashion

870,4.0,"Beautiful Pin, but Disappointing Packaging!","The pin itself was beautiful, but the packaging it came in left much to be desired.  Spending $74 for a pin, I would have expected it to be in a pretty box, suitable for gift giving.  The description page said it would come in a nice signature pouch with artist's signature.  It did not. It should have been packaged more carefully & in a better container.  It was simply in a thin plastic baggie & then in a very thinly padded envelope.  I can hardly even call it padded, it was so thin.  It could easily have been crushed or bent, there was no protection whatsoever!  I'm surprised it made it okay, as it was delivered the same day along with a heavy box.  I ordered 2 other pins on Amazon a few weeks earlier, one from Richapex for $45 that came with a gorgeous gift box & that was inside a 2nd box for protection. Another from Alilang for only $15.99 in a beautiful gift box, also inside a very thick padded envelope for protection.  So, you can see why I was surprised with the way this much more expensive pin was sent.  Again, the pin was gorgeous!  I had already picked out quite a few more pins & other jewelry from this company for gifts for my family, but won't be ordering them now.  It's a shame really.

872,4.0,Good product,The wrap worked well but it didn't stay cool for very long. I was not able to put the wrap in ice water so I would like to try it again with the water being colder to see if that makes a difference or not,B019MIE1UU,Amazon_Fashion
873,4.0,Very good value.,"Really impressed with this set. It is much heavier than I thought it would be, and I look forward to using it in photo shoots over the next few years. Given the quality of the build, it should easily last that long.<br />Seems to be a very good build quality, even up close.<br />I am very happy with it.",B01FQILW66,Amazon_Fashion
874,4.0,Does as advertised.,Pros: Great value for the price. Good quality. Very warm with and without heaters on. Adjustable temperature is awesome. Warm even set at lowest of 40c with ambient temperature at 5c.<br />Cons: Adjustable strap is too short. Even at the maximum adjustment it is way too tight. The gauntlet is too narrow to easily fit over motorcycle jacket sleeves. Inner liner is not securely attached and comes out slightly when taking gloves off.,B08FHQV5YH,Amazon_Fashion

877,4.0,Great tight-fitting bra,"It fit a little tighter then expected, but the company did include an extender in the package which made it wearable. It definitely does not slip and made for some very impressive cleavage.<br /><br />I loved that the inside has what looks like handprints, it made me laugh.",B093766TWC,Amazon_Fashion
878,4.0,This pleases me,"This was exactly what i expected. I wish it came with pins, but that's a non issue. They are comfortable and look very elegant when installed. very happy with this band. Anyone with a black moto 360  will enjoy this!",B00KBOQKNG,Amazon_Fashion
879,4.0,"Nice, but may not last with everyday wear",The belt is okay for the money I paid for it. Luckily I don‚Äôt wear this belt everyday. I do not think it would hold up long to everyday use because of the synthetic materials. The belt fills up the space on the belt loop of my jeans. I like having wider belts with jeans just look better to me. It‚Äôs a good belt that should last for a little while if you just use it a couple times a week but not everyday. Who wears the same belt everyday anyway?,B0775171L9,Amazon_Fashion
880,4.0,I'm sure they are good,They feel good.  I haven't used them for their intended purpose yet.  I get my Gaynor Mindens in a month or so.  I thought they'd help my high heeled pumps not hurt so much in the toe area.  It turns out that I'd have to have a size 10 shoe to fit these buggers in the shoe if I want my foot in there as well.,B000689EOY,Amazon_Fashion
881,4.0,I really appreciate the comfort and versatility of this blouse.,"This top goes perfectly over jeans, is long enough to wear with leggings. What I like is that it's conservative enough to wear to the office, but dressy enough for a night out.<br /><br />KEY NOTE: The flutter sleeves are actually sewn in such a way that when you lift your arms, people CANNOT see your armpit/bra through the opening.",B00ZZM0C6A,Amazon_Fashion

885,4.0,Beautiful,"Arrived as promised. In a resealable reusable plastic bag which can be used to store the masks and lanyards. The masks were a bit big on me, but with the use of the lanyard it fit perfectly.  Appears to be of good quality and I do not feel like I am suffocating while wearing them.  I ordered the animal prints.  They are really beautiful. My only complaint is that I received two of the same masks of the eagle.  Other than that I would order again",B08G1JJRJD,Amazon_Fashion
886,4.0,love it,"it is soooo adorable. the panties would not hold up though but I am a bigger oddly shaped woman so I kind of expected to have to tweak it a tiny bit  the top fit perfect and because Im already a busty girl I got the cute cleavage with out having to wear a bra underneath at all. the ears are a bit cheaply made so if you want a full kitty effect get another pair of ears. the collar fit fine and was comfy. the material is very comfortable and nothing has lost its shape or was damaged. totally in love with it , taking only one star off the the slip and sliding panties though.",B01D2HSAQI,Amazon_Fashion
887,4.0,Pretty Pretty Pretty Good.........,I really like this body suit. Nice compression. My only complaint is that it seems to run long. I am short and don't have a long torso. Even though there are 3 rows of hooks - it is still too long and sometimes the hook closure don't sit right and I get some chaffing. I pretty much wear one of these every day. I'm 5'3&#34; 109 lbs and this is snug on me - not uncomfortably tight - but as a body shaper would do. I plan on buying more.,B00XOE22BO,Amazon_Fashion
888,4.0,As expected,"I'm a 34 C and the medium fits well. I gave it 4 stars because I don't like clasp on the back (it's a hook style, like many swimsuits) and it does look a little cheap - but hey, it is cheap! I got what I expected.",B014P4Q9AQ,Amazon_Fashion
889,4.0,Perfect Summer Blouse‚Ä¶,"First of all my favorite neckline is a v-neck so I was immediately drawn to this beautiful and versatile blouse.  It is made of lightweight chiffon.  It is slightly on the thin side but you would definitely be able to get away with just wearing a bra underneath.  I would guess if you chose white you would need to wear a camisole or tank as well.  I chose ‚ÄúOrange‚Äù which is more of a peach shade.  It‚Äôs a gorgeous and vibrant peach.  I ordered a size up to accommodate my double d‚Äôs and it fits great.  I would also say it runs small so ordering up is a must especially if you‚Äôre busty.<br /><br />It‚Äôs a loose fitting flowy blouse that is super comfortable and suitable for the office or a night out on the town.  The back is longer than the front which I love.  However, an inch or so longer in the front wouldn‚Äôt hurt for busty women.  We automatically lose a few inches in the front due to that.  The sleeves are short which makes it the perfect Summer blouse.<br /><br />I love the color selection available in this lovely blouse.  It‚Äôs very versatile and can be dressed up or down.  It looks great with jeans and heels and a belt around the waist will also be cute look.",B01EHA4DG0,Amazon_Fashion
890,4.0,Cute and worth it!,"I love these rings I'm glad I ordered despite all the negative reviews. I bought midi rings much more expensive and they weren't midi, weren't adjustable, and we're thin and fragile. These I will need to put nail polish so it doesn't turn colors but they are great! Strong durable pretty and actually midi. I have it four stars instead of 5 because of the ring with the words. I can't read the words and they are smushed and I won't use that ring.",B00TJJDJ06,Amazon_Fashion
891,4.0,"Slightly too large, but still usable","I bought based on measurements and mine seem to be a tad too large, but they still serve a purpose (they are fantastic at keeping me warm when I go outside with just this and a hoodie)  so I imagine they'll make me sweat more when I workout with them which will hopefully translate to quicker results üòÅ  will order again.

898,4.0,"Sadly, Mellow Yellow","I was looking forward to gifting this and I was so disappointed when it arrived today. The yellow advertised is bright and vibrant (easy to see), but what I received was a light butter yellow/beige. I was also expecting to see the word &#34;Passport&#34; embossed on the front, but the only thing embossed was the company logo. The product itself looks well made, but knowing I was going to return it, I didn't take it out of the plastic.<br /><br />I could overlook the cover not being what I expected, but the color is so far off, it's not even close to what's being advertised. It's going back and I'll see if I can find a bright yellow cover elsewhere.<br /><br />Edited: I edited this from 3 stars to 4 just because their customer service is amazing. They offered to send me a customized replacement which is above and beyond. If they could create one in bright yellow, I'd take them up on it. The fact that they even offered speaks volumes as to how much they want their customers to be happy.",B014FD8ESC,Amazon_Fashion

906,5.0,Loved these!,I got the 12 months size for my 6 month old. Washed and put them in the dryer. Some shrinkage not alot. But that's to be expected. My little guy is about 17lbs and these give him plenty of room to grow. They are a bit big but I expect that as I buy stuff for him to grow into. Would recommend. Super cute. Good quality average thickness. Very happy with them. I got the red set .,B01HING2E4,Amazon_Fashion

908,5.0,Cute,"I loved the fact that this dress was actually as it was described by the seller. I‚Äôve purchased clothing in the past that could come and not even be close to the description. It is cotton, soft, and form fitting. To my surprise, the bottom half of the dress; you couldn‚Äôt adjust the buttons. It was clearly just for looks but the ones up top you could.

910,5.0,Great travel wallet for men.,"I purchased this men's ultra slim mini small travel wallet with RFID blocking.  The wallet arrived package beautifully in a lovely box and inserted into a luxurious cloth pouch.  This wallet was purchased with my husband in mind.  We travel quite extensively and he is always looking for a wallet that is small in size and that  can easily fit into his front pocket rather than his back pocket.  One of the best things about this wallet is the positioning of the slits for your credit cards.  They are placed inside the bill  compartment  behind the bills.  He feels this makes it safer when travelling and not as easy a target for pickpockets if you carry your valuables in a front or side pocket. The wallet is made of a high quality leather and has the ability to keep someone from taking your credit card information.  It can hold as many as 15 bills at a time. I think this wallet would make a wonderful gift to every gentlemen traveler on your list and I would also recommend this wallet to anyone who travels or also anyone who just likes a smaller silhouette. I received this product at a discount in exchange for writing a review based on the results of my testing it. I am not affiliated with this company and I did not promise to write a positive review when the offer was made. I tested this product thoroughly and do my best to provide detailed reviews to other Amazon customers so they may make informed decisions about their future purchases. It is my intent to highlight features and drawbacks that I, as a consumer, would want to know about before I purchase the product, not to inflate the product's quality for the distributor or manufacturer to increase their sales. It is my hope that these reviews are helpful to others. The views I have expressed here are completely my own and are in no way influenced by the promotion I received.",B01DJWJXGM,Amazon_Fashion

917,5.0,Good alternative to designer,"The sunglasses on the left are the dupe, the sunglasses on the right are the real Celine Tilda‚Äôs. I was looking for a pair to wear around my baby who loves to grab my face. I also dropped my real ones on the ground, and had too many close calls. At $450 dollars a pair I needed a cheaper option for daily use. They are very close, the differences are subtle in my opinion. The shape of the lens is slightly off from the real ones but once you put them on it‚Äôs not noticeable. The 3 silver dots are slightly raised compared to the originals, and while they feel well made, you can tell they are cheaper when holding them compared to the Celine glasses, they are much lighter. The lenses on the dupe are darker as well.  If you are interested in the Celine‚Äôs I would highly recommend trying these first.",B07FDQ3HJX,Amazon_Fashion

The automatic mechanism works well,is accurate,looks good, and the time is easy to read.It does not glow in the dark although it looks like it would. When I first got it, I had trouble setting the time. I couldn't pull out the stem. I unscrewed the stem slightly and was able to pull out the stem and set the time.I then screwed the stem back in. This is the first Field and Stream watch I've ever owned and I am very satisfied with it. Update: I've had this watch for about 2 years now and I'm still extremely happy with it. I own about 20 automatic watches and usually once you take a watch off, it will run for another 2 days or so. This watch lasts about a month! I've never seen anything like it.

944,5.0,Best bag ever!,"I'm the type of person that uses 1 bag until it literally dies and falls apart. That was the case with my last one, which was this same style but different pattern. So, since I was used to it and loved it so much I decided to get it again in this pattern (Heirloom Paisley). I keep my phone in the outside zippered pocket along with my lip balm, easy access, and overly big enough to fit a phone. I do not use the side pockets often. I usually keep my packets of stevia and some bandaids in them cause they're too small for anything else. The inside slip pockets I use for pens, tin of mints, and my inhaler...again, easy access. The inside zippered pocket is big too...The only difference with this bag compared to my old one, is the inside pockets are on are on the opposite sides... for instance, the slip pockets are inside back of bag, and  zipper is inside front - where as they used to be opposite. I hope you get what I'm trying to say lol ....That's taking some getting used to, but it's not a deal breaker.

The arms are exactly the right length, so if you're a &#34;wear em long&#34; kind of sleeve person, this may not work for you. The outer fabric is REALLY soft, like a microfiber. The inner material is fluffy and also very soft. My young niece felt the coat and described it as &#34;cozy&#34; and she's exactly right!

972,5.0,A very nice watch.,"A lot of people nit-pick this watch.  Why? 1. It doesn't have a rotating bezel.  Big deal!  It says that in the description!  I like the stationary bezel, it is never out of alignment.  Think of the numbers as minute/second markers.  2.  It doesn't have a screw down crown.  Once again, it says that in the description.  It is water resistant to 100m, why would it have a screw down crown?  If you have to have a screw down crown, buy a Vostok.  3. It is hard to read.  You have to be kidding me.  It has a big face with big hands and markings, I just don't get this one.  Maybe you need new reading glasses.  4. It costs more than a Duro.  Right, that's because it's solar powered and it never needs batteries.  And it's worth every penny.  It is a very good looking watch, is well made, keeps excellent time, fits very well and has a day-date function.  Just make sure that it gets enough light and it will always be ready to go.

1038,1.0,"36"" convection cooktop - NEVER WORKED!","We purchased this Frigidaire 36"" convection cooktop brand-new in August 2021, had it installed by an electrician, and didn't work. Called Frigidaire customer service on 9/28/21,  got a technician to come by within one day (good) to check it. He said that the main computer of the cooktop was defective, not working. He will order the part. I received a text message from the technician company on 10/11/21 that the part was on back order no ETA. I called Frigidaire customer service on 10/15/21, still waiting for the part to come, to call back in 10 business days. Today 10/29/21 I called Frigidaire customer service and they said they will call the technician service company to find out what part are they waiting for, after a few minutes the customer service rep gave me the part order number and said she just order the part and will be shipped to me on 11/17/21, that I will received it in 2-3 business days after that day, after receiving the part to call them back to set up an appointment with the technician to come and install it for us. So far, bought this brand new cooktop, it will be at least 3 months since we bought it and had not been able to use it!  No cooking in our brand new remodeled kitchen for all this time!! This part of the review (the purchase), I would say, do not buy this brand/model.... I will re-visit my review after I receive the part and the technician comes and try to make it work, we will see..... Well, as I expected, it si now 12/6/21, and no solution for us. No cooktop, no part, no replacement unit as I requested last time I called Customer Service on 11/24/21. On that day the Rep said it will take 5 business days to get an answer from the supervisor or next higher up in the chain.... toady I call back because I did not get a call or email from anybody about the request to get a replacement since its been over 2 months since we bought this mistake! Now I have to wait up tp 7 business days to get an answer if Frigidaire will send me a replacement or not.... I really don't know how to say this but DO NOT BUY this cooktop model. The model as far as me, its not good, and their Customer Service only take messages.... Today's rep said that there was no record of my 11/24/21 call about a replacement.... Its beyond comprehension, that means that we can't even trust a reputable brand name company to help their customers, in other words, the rep never wrote down in my file about this replacement request and lied about it, This is too much!!

All this after a bit more than 6 months' family use.<br /><br />We also found that although we live in an urban area with a lot of appliance repair shops, there are relatively few who work on Samsungs (and the one we found missed most of the problems). Then we discovered that parts for this thing do not seem to be stocked cy local sources and have to be ordered from Samsung direct.<br /><br />With an unresponsive repair shop and laundry piling up, I went to replace the drive belt myself, which is when I learned that the design of this thing is such that you have to disassemble most of the unit to get to the motor.

1106,2.0,Overall a good unit,I bought this unit based on the look and style. Very impressed with it's performance. Was easy to install and one question I had for their service department was answered quickly with genuine concern about my installation issue. It is quiet and powerful.<br />My one thing that I think is a design error is the location of the hood lights. The halogen lights are located in the rear of the hood. This causes the light to be cast upon the rear wall and not over the food. My solution was to disconnect these lights and install two new lights in the center of the hood. The result is that the lighting is now over the cook top and the food. Whoever designed this aspect obviously isn‚Äôt a cook.,B009KX4Z8Q,Appliances

You can NOT turn off the notification for when you check the room quality on the sensor itself.<br />* the product advertises ""air quality"", but only shows CO2. I was expecting a wider range of measurements so I could learn about what pollutants are drifting in from the city.<br />* there is no ""so what?"" in the app. If my CO2 level is a little too high, what can I do about it? I'm thinking about how tools like FitBit have more elaborate explanations for the factors you should pay attention to.<br />* but the WORST part about this product is the lack of integration to services like IFTTT.

1181,2.0,Flawed Design that results in weak watery coffee,"We recently bought a dual maker that does K cups to give us some added flexibility and went with these reusable cups. We found that when we make coffee with these cups they are always very weak and watery. This is due to a few design flaws that you learn after testing these out. Flaws: There is entirely too much mesh on the cup that results in water escaping the cup (versus forcing the water through the coffee grinds). Also adding to the watery cups is the top of the cup has a wide inlet of water that also allows water to take shortest path through the mesh.  Also worth noting is that these cups will leave grind debris in the bottom of your cups.  the kcup paper filters will resolve the debris problem but the cups are still very weak. We found a reusable 2 pack at walmart that had half as much mesh and a long thin vertical water insert and the coffee was to our liking again.

1198,2.0,THIS IS HUGE AND LOUD! About a foot higher than the old school college dorm refrigerators.,"UPDATE:  MAY 27,2019 This refrigerator just keeps humming louder and louder. It's in an adjacent bedroom, I wear ear plugs, and it's STILL so loud.<br />The freezer keeps getting a 1/4"" of frost. I would not recommend this for anyone unless you're going to keep it in your garage for refrigeration only.<br /><br />UPDATE: After using the refrigerator/ freezer six months,  I had to lower the review down to 3 Stars.  It is VERY loud.  It hums SO loudly,  I can hear it through the walls and it's in the room across the hall.<br />Also, having such an expensive mini frig/ freezer made with such cheap plastic is unfortunate. The freezer itself gets super cold and the refrigerator, too. My only gripe with the refrigerator is there's a constant layer of moistness; the refrigerator sweats inside, which is because the motor gets really hot, and it's in the back/ bottom of the refrigerator.<br /><br />This refrigerator HUMS LOUDLY. If you're planning on having it in your bedroom/dorm I'd think again.  (At first it didn't hum loudly, now after a week plugged in it's loud. Put in other bedroom. UPDATE: After six months of use the humming is unbearably loud,  especially at night when the humming travels through the walls or floor [or both], and it's located in the room across the hall,  on a platform, not against the wall.) The reviewer who said his house guest could not stand the loud humming from this frig wasn't exaggerating.<br /><br />After the first night I already had to unplug to melt the ice and frost off the bottom of the freezer. Turned down the temp. Hope that works. (After six months: the temp has been set to MEDIUM and there is a 1/4"" of snow cone like ice on all four walls of the freezer.)<br /><br />I'll update durability after a few months.<br />(The top is cheap plastic. Can't store anything heavy on top. Thirty years ago, my college apartment mini fridge was 100% metal on the outside. THAT was durable. Kept my practice guitar amp on top [30 lbs].

Make sure you insert it with one of the slots in the lid pointing straight up, or it could cause damage to the cams in the upper assembly over time.<br />2. Since they do not have as fine a filter as K cups, the coffee shoots out the bottom of it at rather high pressure and usually splashes out of the cup, causing extra clean up.

That element failed after only 4 months (the coil wire had broken at the terminal connection, showing evidence of melting from overheating - perhaps the crimping had actually cut the coil wire partially, increasing electrical resistance; also noticed that particular terminal was a bit loose thru the insulator).  That seller had vanished into the ether, so I had to plead with Amazon to get a refund.  I ordered this Blue Stars kit primarily because they promised satisfaction guaranteed.  When that element arrived, I noticed that one of its terminals was loose in the insulator, too, but did not see any visible damage to coil wires in the crimped area.  Emailed Blue Stars about the loose terminal, asking whether that was anything to be concerned about.  Finally got a clear reply that the looseness was not a problem.  However, in the process of email back and forth, Blue Stars stated they would ""support"" return/exchange/refund within 30 days - not exactly ""satisfaction guaranteed"" in my view.  So, while this heating element is the correct OEM equivalent replacement, and is working just fine (so far), it remains to be seen if the seller will actually back up that satisfaction guaranteed promise.",B074QLYQ59,Appliances

In the manual it says 24"" is OK.  On the item itself it says 26"" minimum distance from the cabinet bottom to range top.  The range hood was installed by professionals who recommended the combo of a gas stove with 5 burners for this hood, while Zephyr says that this hood is under powered for a gas stove with 5 burners at a mounting distance of 24"".  Zephyr also said that you must run the hood anytime while cooking because as well as decreasing the smells resulting from cooking, it also dissipates heat.  In addition this hood is recommended to have a 6"" round duct to the outside, or a 3.5 x 10""  rectangular venting duct.  Our older house was fitted with a 4"" duct which further increases the strain on the motor while venting both smell and heat.<br /><br />Zephyr replaced the control panel, as a one time courtesy, but a change in materials is warranted if this is to be a range hood for people who actually want to cook using the hood as opposed to light to very light cooking only.

1249,3.0,Bad Compressors and Poor Phone Support,"My LG refrigerator is less than 2 years old.  The compressor failed on October 30.  When I called LG, I was told that there was only a 1-year warrantee, so the repair would be at my expense. She told me to open and close the freezer doors, but this didn‚Äôt work.<br />I decided to contact a local service repairman and after he looked at the fridge (and a $75 fee), he told me the compressor was bad and that he was seeing a lot of these bad compressors on LG refrigerators.  The product looks nice and has some great features, but it does me no good if they install bad compressors.  After some research, we found that there is a class action lawsuit for this problem before 2018.  Shame on LG for continuing to sell cheap, unreliable products.<br />After more research on my own, I found out that these compressors have a 5-year warrantee, so I had new hope.  Too bad LG did not volunteer this information on the phone.<br />So I decided to call LG directly once again.  On November 10, I called LG to inform them about the diagnosis of a compressor problem.  The man I spoke to in service was incompetent and unable to speak in an understandable manner. He assured me that I had an appointment on November 12 between 8-12 AM.  So I stayed home that day waiting for the repair visit.<br />At noon that day there was no phone call and no visit.  So I called LG once again to report this issue.  The lady who handled the call said she had no record of the appointment.  Also, she had no record of my problem, no model number, no address, etc. This was my third time talking to LG!  She proceeded to reschedule the appointment, but there was another delay of 5 days.  She mentioned it would be fixed free of charge for my inconvenience.<br />On Monday, November 16, I was contacted by LG the day before my new assigned appointment. This was much appreciated!  And on November 17 a competent repairman changed out my compressor.  So after 2 ¬Ω weeks I finally had a working refrigerator.<br />In the end it only cost me $75 for an initial diagnosis. However, the phone help line at LG is very poor and this weakness should be corrected by the company.",B076J241YS,Appliances

1254,3.0,Simple and effective!,"This washer is amazing!  It‚Äôs simple to use and helps me save water since I don‚Äôt have to hand wash.  Not to mention it cleans items better than I can hand wash them.  The turbine starts slow, but really picks up steam a minute into the wash cycle.  It also slows down near the end.  I have a feeling this washer will be a real life saver as time goes on.<br /><br />UPDATE:  Originally, I had this at five stars.  Full disclosure, I bought the cheapest mini motorized washing machine I could find to try.  I was hoping to get at least six months out of this machine, but I‚Äôm not easy with things.  The issues the machine is now having are partly my fault and the fact that this is a cheap machine.  (I‚Äôve only had it for about a month and a half).<br /><br />Since the instructions are also minimalistic, I‚Äôll note down my tips and tricks.  First, the little machine has a sensors to help balance the load.  If there is an imbalance or the contents are too much, it will shut off automatically.  I would suggest not to fill the machine (clothes and water) higher than three fourths of the basin.<br /><br />Second, I usually did two cycles.  The first cycle was the main wash with a little detergent and vinegar with an average wash time of 15-20 minutes.  Second cycle was the rinse with some hydrogen peroxide and a few drops of essential oil of my choice with an average rinse time of 10 minutes.  As this is too minimalistic for a spin cycle, ringing out the clothes by hand was very little extra chore considering I wasn‚Äôt hand washing.<br /><br />Third, if the clothes were really dirty, I did an optional pre-wash to shake off the grim.  I would normally put a little hydrogen peroxide for this one too (5-10 minutes).<br /><br />Last, what happened to the machine.  I wanted to soak some very soiled items overnight, which managed to mess up the sensor.  The machine works fine with nothing in it.  It even works fine with ONLY one fourth filled with water.  Anything else, it will start a spin in one direction, next do two rotations in the opposite direction, then stop because it thinks the load is imbalanced.  Since I cannot return it, I‚Äôll recycle it in the next electronics recycling event.<br /><br />My advice:  If you need a delicate no frills machine for your small items, this machine will likely last as I wished it would if you are careful.  If you are just wanting to try out a mini washing machine, buy one of the slightly more expensive four star rated machines.  Try it out as soon as you get it, and return it fast if it‚Äôs not for you.",B08Q799HRW,Appliances

Attempting to attach this to several different metal surfaces it would simply fall off.

I purchased this thinking it would be far easier to deal with just 1 or 2 5gallon jugs.  The biggest issues I have so far are:<br /><br />1.  The insulation separating the hot from the cold is insufficient.  I kept wondering why the cooler was running all the time, and since I had some bottles of water in the fridge just turned off the cold-water part of the cooler.  When I then got out what should have been room-temp water, it was noticeably warmer than it should have been.  That's when I realized the hot water line was heating up the cold water, making it run needlessly.<br /><br />2.  There is still a plasticy, chemical like taste from the lines.  I've gone through 5 gallons and its still there.  I'm wondering what to do next.<br /><br />The looks, the ease of use, and the hot water on demand are all very nice, and have prevented me from returning it when I noticed its faults.

Customer service offered to refund my purchase and also offered a replacement inline filter, which I accepted. The replacement, a Waterdrop WD-15UC-UF, has a filter that twists into a mounting head with 1/4"" PTC inlets and outlets. After my previous installation failure, I installed a different filter kit with parts that also uses 1/4"" PTC lines. When it is time to replace the filter, it should be easy to replace it with this Waterdrop filter and head assembly using the same 1/4"" PTC connections.<br /><br />Although I haven't installed the Waterdrop replacement yet, the customer service has been great and AquaCrest/Waterdrop wants to make things right. I have no qualms about purchasing another product from them because they're willing to stand behind it.<br /><br />Original review below:<br />I purchased this to filter water going to my ice maker. Unfortunately, I didn't get a chance to put it to use.  Its mainly cheap, poorly made junk.<br /><br />First, the metal adapter and hex nut assembly to connect the tubing to my fridge's water inlet would not fit. I simply could not screw on the hex nut, and it turned out the plastic compression ring was too large. It wouldn't fit snugly enough for the hex nut to grip onto the threads.<br /><br />My alternate plan was to reuse my existing 1/4 compression water supply line and connect it to the filter using the metal quick connect to compression adapter. Unfortunately, despite pushing it in snugly it kept leaking. I decided to remove it and to try the second metal quick connect to compression adapter that came in the package.<br /><br />Removing the metal adapter from the filter was a disaster. I had pushed it in snugly, but when I pressed down on the quick connect release it would not budge. Connecting and disconnecting the plastic tubing was easy, but the metal adapter was not meant to be removed. I eventually pulled it out, but the quick connect locking mechanism was shot. The plastic tubing would just slide in and out now.<br /><br />So now I have a busted filter and a bunch of ill fitting parts. Stay away from this piece of junk and find a more reputable brand.",B07Y9S7L29,Appliances

I check the external cabinet temp regularly and while it does get quite warm to the touch, it seems to be okay installed as is. A good idea is to keep it out first time it cools down your drinks (it will work quite hard doing this), then when the compressor cycles off (ie- it has reached its set temp), you can push it back in.

I did the install myself, connected to the cold water line and didi not use the 'operate furnace blower when call for humidity' option as this won't do much with cold water and slightly better with hot water.

Many think the same RH should be maintained throughout the year but this is not true and the auto sensor compensates for this.

Love it and decided to try making my own to have at home. I bought cheap nut bag to try out and then based on the reviews here tried these.<br /><br />They are relatively easy to use, but I hadn't initially realized how long the DIY version takes, so I have to learn to plan ahead! I don't think my home version is as good or as &#34;crisp&#34; tasting as the SB version, but that may be operator error. An article I read elsewhere said it was fine to use any old grocery store coffee because the cold brew method would bring out the best, and I figured great - this would save me money. Unfortunately when I make hot coffee, I'm used to using freshly ground beans that I buy from a local roaster, so it may be that I'm just used to that. Not saying it's at all bad, esp with a little cream, just not the same. I also found there were some grounds in the pitcher, so I used my handy melita funnel and re-filtered through that; this may be because I was using the pre-ground coffee. No deductions there.<br /><br />I did deduct a star for two reasons : one is the need to boil them first, and the fact that those instructions were buried after the the ones on how to make coffee, so I didn't see them until after I made my first pitcher and went to read how to clean the bags. Then I was worried that if there was something so noxious in the manufacturing that I needed to boil them for 5 minutes, I shouldn't drink that coffee, so had to boil and start over. (Really, it would have been soooo much more user friendly if the manufacturer would just send them pre-cleaned). The other reason is that I thought the bag was more difficult to clean and use than it had to be. My other &#34;starter&#34; bag that I tried had rounded corners so the grounds didn't get stuck in there like they did in this bag with square corners. Yeah, they eventually rinsed out, but I'd rather be able to turn it inside out and dump the grounds in the trash. Also, I found the opening of the bag to be a little too small to get the coffee into easily without spilling. I measured my coffee in a 1 cup measuring cup and that wouldn't fit in the opening.<br /><br />I'm not saying I wouldn't buy the bags again if I needed to, but with rounded corners and a wider opening I'd probably spring for new ones before I actually needed them.",B00QG1Y18E,Appliances

I did some research on the internet and &#34;experts&#34; suggested a fix which involved taking almost the whole washing machine apart. I decided to take the risk and purchase this replacement part. It turns out that the fix was very easy. There is one big screw in the center. You take that out by wiggling the old part out (it takes a bit of effort as it seems the magnets want to keep it in place). Then you just put in the new part, put the screw back in, put the cover back on and you are done. It's really quite easy.<br /><br />Note that the failure is because the wheel has plastic spokes that engage with the &#34;tumbler&#34;. These plastic spokes broke off so the wheel could not turn the &#34;tumbler&#34; anymore. This new part also has plastic spokes so eventually it will fail again. I read that supposedly there are some wheels with metal spokes.

1356,4.0,These filters are great for making a whole carafe instead of one cup ...,"These filters are great for making a whole carafe instead of one cup of coffee at a time in the Keurig K2.0 coffeemaker.<br />They appear to be of good quality and they do the job as intended. The only problem that I have with the reusable filters is that there is some fine residue left in the bottom of your coffee cup after drinking. This is true of the Keurig brand also and I believe that it is because the fine filter screen cannot be fine enough to filter out this residue. My solution to this problem is to use a paper filter (like a basket filter) shaped around a small shot glass, then insert it into the reusable filter, use a funnel to fill with coffee and trim off the amount that will not fit into the filter so the top will close. It works fine for me and the residue and grounds are kept in the paper which can be pulled out and thrown into the trash.<br />You have to experiment with the type of coffee that you want to use in the filter so the quantity used is right to suit your taste. It might take several tries to get it just right, but it certainly saves money over using the expensive K-cups. I like Maxwell House medium roast and having tried several times to get it right, I've found that 3 level tablespoons of this coffee in the filter is about right for the 4-5 cup setting on the machine.<br />I think you'll be satisfied with these filters if you want to use a coffee of your choice in the Keurig machine. I don't know if custom paper filters are available for this use or what they might cost, but like I say, regular Dollar Store basket filters work fine, you just have to trim off the top after filling with coffee so the top can be closed.<br /><br />I received this product, Fill N Save 2 Pack Reusable Carafe K-Cups.

Our laundry is on the second floor and we found that a lot of traditional products that are sold were not going to be an easy install for one reason or another. We thought of putting metal netting inside, but a laundry repair person cautioned me against using a screen that was too fine or it would trap stray lint and become a fire hazard.<br /><br />We purchased this product on a whim after being awoken by birds in the vent - again - at about 5 am. I think I ordered it from my phone in my bed without doing too much research. I'm pleased to say it works GREAT, but I will forewarn you that we were a little nervous after receiving it.

It certainly helps keep used K-cups out of the landfill and the price per cup is a fraction of the cost of K-cups.  I admit that it is a little less convenient than the K-cups (you have to put a scoop of coffee in it) and that may bother some people.

When dispensing ice or water you can't open the right door without it stopping the dispensing process which is very annoying and makes no sense as you can open both lower drawers while dispensing. The ice maker is VERY slow at dispensing ice. When ice drops into the plastic tray it is very loud. When replacing the filter, a fair amount of water leaks out.

Coffee was watered down too much to drink.  Poured it in the sink.<br /><br />Second brew:<br />I filled the filter cup almost to the top of the same coffee.  As full as made sense if you ask me.  I then brewed a small cup instead.<br />results: 1 ground that I noticed in the last sip of my coffee.  None escaped the filter cup though.  Coffee was perfect this time.  This is the method I'll be using going forward.<br /><br />The reason for 4/5 stars is due to the fact that I don't think I'll be able to make a large cup with this for fear that it will be watered down.

1388,4.0,Almost As Good As The K-Cups,"I did a side by side comparison of this filter and a K-Cup using my favorite Starbucks House Blend....one a K-Cup, the other this reusable filter using my own ground coffee.  My top criteria was taste.<br /><br />Used Keurig B60 with both.<br /><br />Results: I could not take any discernable difference in the taste with either brew.  The only difference I noticed was that the K-Cup's output was slightly clearer when I observed in 2 identical wine glasses (yeah, I know, who drinks coffee in wine glasses, but I just wanted a comparison.)<br /><br />I believe this is due to the tighter weave of the paper filters in K-Cups vs. the reusable metal filter.<br /><br />In any event, this product reduces my cost/serving from let's say $1 in a K-Cup to around $.10.  What I gain in $$ I of course lose in the grinding of the beans and the washing of the filter.  Easy decision, to say nothing of the environmentally better way.

1390,4.0,tips for Black & Decker Home Cafe users...,"In my experiments, these refillable pods will work in the B&D Home Cafe ONLY IF you do the following:<br /><br />1. CAREFULLY trim the tiny little tabs off the pod lid with a razor blade.  On the Home Cafe unit, these tabs prevent the pod from creating a seal.  Otherwise the steam/water goes around the pod and you get nothing but hot water in your cup!  When you are done the circumference of the pod lid should be a perfect circle.  Don't worry about the missing tabs, the pod is still easy to open.<br /><br />2. DO NOT FILL THE POD completely with packed fine ground coffee - the pressure created by the expansion of the ground coffee WILL break the screen on the pod.  Fortunately, there are two pods in the pack, so after experimenting until I broke one, I still have one left!<br /><br />Note, the dilemma is that the coffee gets BETTER the finer you grind the coffee and the more densely you pack the pod - right up to the point when it breaks!  So I suggest starting with looser packed pods, and only pack more if you REALLY like dark, rich, almost expresso-like coffee and are willing to lose a couple of pods until you finally master the art of packing them.<br /><br />However, when I finally got it right at the limit - and mixed a grind of chocolate velvet beans and dark roasted columbian beans - wow! what an excellent cup of coffee!<br /><br />Good luck, Home Cafe users!",B0007INM5A,Appliances

1396,4.0,Love it! Great compact little guy,"Love this guy.  It does a nice load of laundry, I can usually get away with 2, maybe 3 days of laundry (and that usually includes a set of PJ's and two workout clothes).  It does a find job on shirts, socks etc.  It struggles a bit with multiple pairs of pants, or lots of long sleeve shirts.  The legs or arms tend to tangle themselves pretty good.  I haven't tried to do towels yet, but I'm not really expecting much.  But for everyday stuff its great.<br /><br />Mostly I love its size.  I have a tiny tiny apartment and a tiny bathroom, with only about a 15X15 inch space directly in front of the toilet.  So I bought the Panda and the Nina Spin Dryer to go with it.  The Panda fits *perfectly* on top of the Nina.  When its time for laundry, I simply place the Panda perfectly on top of the (lowered) toilet seat cover so it sits next to my shower.  That way I can fill it easily with a handheld shower head and drain it directly into the tub (its a gravity drain btw).  When laundry (and spin) is done, I just put the Panda back on top of the Nina to get it out of the way but not take up living or storage space.  I highly recommend this setup.  So easy.<br /><br />I'd give it 5 stars but I think my setup is ideal for it so it might not be as easy for other people.  Also, I was lucky it fit so well on top of the Nina and toilet, although I have a normal if not small toilet.

They immediately went to work on fixing the problem of peeling ink, and their new sign is exactly what I'd hoped for when I bought the first one.  An excellent product!  I plan to buy more for friends because everyone seems to have this problem with dishwashers.  (OLD REVIEW:  I bought this item because it looked extremely sturdy (which it is) and because I did not want to interfere with the streamline look of my kitchen by adding a large and/or clunky item to the front of my dishwasher.  I use Cascade Platinum in a KitchenAid Dishwasher on Pro-clean and Pro-dry cycles, and at most, this little sign has gone through 15 cleaning cycles.  Facing the front of the dishwasher, it hasn't taken the brunt of the wash action.  The paint is literally peeling off.  Knowing what I know, I would not buy it again.",B08WY86QY9,Appliances

There's also a tube connected from this sensor to the bottom of the tub - my tube was not blocked, but if your tube is clogged that can also cause the same problem.

1431,5.0,HUGE upgrade from the typical standard over the range hood,"This is an excellent hood and a massive upgrade from any of the typical terrible low end option. I upgraded from a Broan hood that was only a few years old and did a better job at spreading smoke and steam throughout the kitchen than actually exhausting anything out of the house. This Tatsumaki is an incredible upgrade and draws an incredible amount of air out of the house. More importantly, it's larger. At 8&#34; high it's a full two inches taller than the Broan it replaced which is good because it hangs down closer to the range and captures more. It also sticks out further so all of the steam from the front two burners no longer just bypasses as it did with the old hood. The whole front is rounded so no concerns about hitting my head on it.<br />You have to take off the bottom in order to mount it and you see the fan blades which look like the front of jet engines.

1444,5.0,Works as Replacement for Other Part Numbers,"The first symptom was a very noisy fan.  The last symptom before it died was a surging (revving) sound about once a second.

The red, yellow/black, and yellow to white voltages were all around 13VDC - good.  The actual replacement took me about 1.5 hours.  Most important here is that this unit works as a replacement for WR60X10151 (obsolete number) and WR60X10228.  When I removed the old unit it had the exact same number (WR6oX10185) on it.

When you do locate a source (for example Whole Foods, Bed Bath & Beyond, Crate and Barrel or right here on Amazon where is price is ridiculous) they will either be out of stock or ‚Äúavailable again‚Äù in...well..months.  So I bought this and brewed a cup of coffee using whole beans ground on the medium setting. Not bad. Except for the sediment that made it through the filter and into the cup. Not good. The solution I‚Äôve come up with is to line the Kone filter with 1/4 of a square Chemex paper filter. (See photo above). A box of 100 filters will therefore yield 400 pours so I‚Äôll only have to deal with buying them once a year).  I don‚Äôt notice a huge difference when it comes to taste. Also, after tossing the paper filter and grounds in the trash the Kone itself has no residual grounds to deal with so cleaning it is a snap and my plumbing is spared.",B00E58P6WU,Appliances

1452,5.0,Wonderful Addition to the fridge,"The slider works great. Locks in 3 different positions, closed, half pulled out, and fully pulled out. I mounted mine in a 1994 Bronco, fit perfectly.

I got lucky as everything was perfect. If you are going to mount it in a vehicle make sure the backside and the sides has ample room for air to circulate around the fridge. A couple inches on each side works fine. One issue I did have was a few of the screws that held the slider together were loose and I lost them during installation. I need to remove one from the unit to be able to get additional screws. Not a big deal, but would be nice not to have to deal with it. Fridge works amazing as well.

I normally only change my filters once a year in the spring for running the A/C, since I use hot water radiators, rather than forced air for heat.

Personally, 340 g coffee with 8c water for 16 hours in the countertop produces about 6c of quality concentrate for me.<br /><br />Pros: No need to change filters. No bulky system to store in cabinets or on the counter. Coffee quality has been good.<br /><br />Cons: Some coffee grounds will stick to the bag when emptying it, and will need to be rinsed into the sink.

1457,5.0,"Exactly like the originals, only better","These are almost identical in appearance, and have a very similar weight as the OEM Samsung knobs. The main difference between these and OEM is that there is a tiny metal cap over the end where it usually cracks open.<br /><br />These knobs are just a hair lighter in weight than OEM, but they‚Äôre still hefty. These weighed in at 80 grams each, while the OEM knobs weigh 95 grams apiece. A US nickel weighs 5 grams, so the difference in weight is exactly three nickels.<br /><br />The font is a little different if you look closely, but it‚Äôs similar enough to the OEM font that you could easily pass it off as the same. I don‚Äôt think changing just one is a good idea, I‚Äôm just saying nobody would notice.<br /><br />I‚Äôve seen people on the tubes repair their cracked knobs by clamping tiny hose clamps over the split ends, or by slipping a small piece of pipe over the end to keep it together. But by the time it‚Äôs split, the knob's already badly damaged, so I figured it was safer to just get new ones.<br /><br />With the metal caps reinforcing the ends, the problem should be solved. I think these will last for many years.<br /><br />Hope this helps.",B083HRNMML,Appliances

The ice is smaller than I'm used to but works great.  I will say this - BE CAREFUL to make sure the water inlet is installed correctly.  When you slide the unit into place the water inlet fits into whats best described as a slide that flows the water into the tray.  I screwed that up and the water inlet went under the slide.  This was in a rental unit we're fixing up so the property set vacant for a week after installing it.  After coming back I had a 4"" thick ice block in the bottom of the freezer.  Good on Frigidaire for having some quality door seals that held that water in and didn't ruin the brand new floors we had installed.  Took 8 hours and heat gun to clear that block out.

1471,5.0,Great machine,"*** IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR CLEANING INSTRUCTIONS, SEE #3 BELOW ***<br /><br />This is a great ice maker, but here are a few things to consider.<br /><br />1. It is not an icebox, so any ice it makes will start melting after it is dispensed -- and because it's not cubed ice, I think it probably melts a little faster. The ice is stored in a little basket above the water tank, so it just recycles the melted water into new ice. The ice get a little wet and slushy the longer it sits, but fortunately this machine makes fresh ice quickly.<br />2. The ice accumulates in such a way that it usually triggers the ""ice basket is full"" sensor even though the basket isn't really full. So usually in the morning I'll open the lid and ""pull"" the stacked ice away from the sensor and into the basket so it will resume making ice immediately.<br />3. Cleaning the machine isn't difficult, but it's a little time-consuming. Here's how I do it. (A) Drain the water tank via the plug under the water tank. (B) Replace the plug and add 2 cups of vinegar and 2 cups of water to the water tank. (C) Start the cleaning cycle by pressing the ON/OFF/CLEAN button for 5 seconds -- the S / L lights will alternate blinking when the cleaning cycle is running. (D) Wait -- I haven't timed it but it seems like 20 or 30 minutes. (E) After the cleaning cycle has stopped, drain the water tank and refill with fresh water. (F) Run the cleaning cycle again so you don't end up with vinegar-tasting ice. (G) Drain once more before resuming making ice.<br /><br />Again, none of these issues are deal-breakers. It makes ice quickly. We drink a lot of ice coffee in our house, so this machine is perfect. Just keep in mind it's not an icebox and needs occasional cleaning depending on your water quality.",B0C57WMPJQ,Appliances

1478,5.0,Works great and cheaper than the Kenmore part,"I paid ~$1000 for my Kenmore 106.51132 210 side-by-side refrigerator/freezer in July 2016. The freezer light (what this part replaces) went out shortly after the 13-month warranty expired, so I didn't bother to get it fixed. Then a few weeks ago both fridge lights quit out a the same time. Sears/Kenmore wanted $99 for someone to come over just to take a look at it, and then labor and parts to repair would be on top of that. A quick search for part costs showed the main fridge light WPW10515058 (replacing W10515058) would be $185.90 MSRP and the freezer light WPW10515057 (replacing W10515057) would be $100.00. DIY sites also indicated two things: (1) The secondary fridge light (also WPW10515057) would likely resume functioning after replacing the main fridge light, and (2) The brightness of the main fridge light may depend on the freezer light working properly. Both of these turned out to be true.<br /><br />I verified it was easy to remove both lights, and then ordered the Icetech W10515058 and Icetech W10515058 replacement (this part). Per their direction, I flipped off the fridge breaker (easier than unplugging it), extracted the old one using a flathead screwdriver, disconnected the wires, reconnected them to the new part, and installed it. Turning back on the breaker, the secondary fridge light worked perfectly, and the main fridge light worked at about 80% brightness, which is probably all I was getting out of the original part.<br /><br />Then I repeated the process with the Icetech W10515057 replacement (this part), which also worked properly, and the fridge light replacement now works at 100% brightness.<br /><br />I figure going with this solution saved me about $300 in parts and labor for both lights, plus the satisfaction of doing it myself.<br /><br />Only reason I'm giving it 4 stars for value is that it's truly insane that a glorified refrigerator lightbulb is 10-20% the cost of the entire unit.",B07WW1ZJ8V,Appliances

This item did not come with instructions but I had watched the instructional video mentioned in the answers above and decided I would probably be able to install it. I ordered the part, received it and set about installing it watching the video mentioned..... Oh, no!! My refrigerator was slightly different and those instructions weren't addressing things I needed to know to do the replacement. An internet search using the make and this part number resulted in a video that made installation a piece of cake!! Phew!! Took less than and hour and works perfectly! As a plus, I was able to clean all of the nooks and crannies I was not able to get clean without taking it apart (which I've now done).",B015WY7X30,Appliances

1487,5.0,Worked perfectly in my DV210AEW dryer,"My Samsung DV210AEW dryer stopped heating. It still worked normally and showed no error codes, but as there was no hot air the clothes took an inordinate amount of time to dry!<br />Quick internet research narrowed it down to one of several things - the thermal fuse in the blower assembly, or either the thermal fuse or thermostat in the heater assembly. In theory I could have tested each of those to determine which had failed; however, this kit of parts was cheap enough that I could replace all three.<br />Installation took about 45 minutes. I had to remove the top panel, then the control fascia, and then the front of the dryer - just a few screws.<br />Note that contrary to some reports, the blower assembly fuse CAN be replaced without removing the drum, as long as you have fairly small hands and a short, stubby Philips screwdriver to reach around behind the blower. For the other two items, the heater assembly can be pulled out easily. While I was there I also replaced the heater element; the old one was blackened. I also took the chance to remove several years' worth of fluff!<br />These components arrived promptly and were exactly as described. My thanks to the seller.",B01N7OH8F0,Appliances

Then the trouble started.<br /><br />The camera would disconnect randomly from our phones in the middle of the night and at odd times.  Our internet service is excellent and we have no issues streaming 4k movies in any of the rooms in our house.  Despite this, the signal kept dropping to the point where we felt the baby camera was too unreliable to do the one thing it is supposed to do ... reliably monitor the baby.<br /><br />We attempted to reach out to Miku customer service but that went nowhere.

1522,1.0,This is a stupid product,"There is no practical use for this product. There are two options to use this as per their instructions:<br />1.

However when you attempt this and nothing comes out, you read the instructions and they say you have to bite down to take a drink. HUH?! First of all, this is difficult for an adult to do let alone a young child or elderly person. Even when doing this method ""correctly"" about 3 drops come out. So you have to simultaneous bite and suck to get a few drops of water...? No thanks.<br />2. The second option is to shove a reusable straw in the opening after you've put the contraption in a bottle. Guess what's no longer leak proof? The water bottle with the irrelevant silicone attachment and a straw sticking out of it! If I wanted to drink out of a bottle of water with a straw, I don't need an extra attachment to do so...<br />Also as one final bottom line, whichever ridiculous way you plan to use this useless product, it leaks at the connection to the water bottle.

1531,1.0,"Horrible monitor design, worse customer service.","I am so disappointed by this camera/monitor. We thought it was the best on the market. Here are the issues I have with it:<br /><br />* There is no on/off switch on the monitor. You have to hold the on/off button for some time to turn on, fine, but to turn off you have to hold it for a while, then release and then re-hold for some more time until you see it flash. So dumb. Sometimes you think its off and it's not.<br /><br />* The actual image is not as great as you'd expect from a $250+ camera. Grainy.<br /><br />* When you turn off the camera, the monitor beeps incessantly until you shut it off. See above.<br /><br />* The monitor battery drains FAST. SO FAST. It's ALWAYS being charged. When the battery gets low it beeps incessantly. See above.<br /><br />* Becuase the monitor always needs to be charged and you want to keep it nearby, plugging into a wall is not always the most convenient spot, it is often plugged (USB) into my laptop. So as you can imagine, when a baby suddenly wakes up crying and you rush to soothe the baby, the stupid monitor perpetually plugged into my computer went flying as I moved my computer quickly to get up. My monitor crashed to the floor and cracked - broken. I can NOT get the warranty info from Amazon or Samsung. Emails go unanswered by Samsung and Amazon says to email Samsung. I am beyond frustrated with this product.<br /><br />* When you do turn on the monitor it flashes BIG across the whole screen NO SD CARD. It goes away after a bit, but fairly annoying after a while. It pops up every time you turn it on. I eventually bought a stupid SAMSUNG MICRO SD card (just to get it to stop) and it did not work. The monitor froze up and would no longer work. I had to remove the SD card and turn the monitor on and off a couple times to return to the annoying (yet functional) NO SD CARD screen.<br /><br />I need to buy a new system and I would NOT recommend this system to anyone. Save your money and try something else.<br /><br />Lastly, I rarely am moved to leave a negative review, but this product and the lack of customer services and the high price led me to want to warn other parents out there.

1582,1.0,It feels like a material you'd find in a cheapo Halloween costume ...,"I have an 1970-something home, with railing that have stiles about 7-8"" apart. Newer homes don't have this problem, as some buildings codes (+common sense) have changed to mandate stiles closer together. The problem I had was, 7-8"" is more than enough space for my infant to crawl between. Enter the acquisition of 'this' product and my following review.<br /><br />Very cheap construction. It feels like a material you'd find in a cheapo Halloween costume that falls apart by the end of the night. The strings this ships with are very flexible nylon strings, which make no sense whatsoever because you want this net to be secure and not easily pulled up/away from the railing. If you give the strings good tug to tighten them up, they snap. The outer seam around the netting is a thin material that has small holes stamped, most of which have the inner round section of the stamp still in place. The punched holes are 'exactly' the diameter of the string, so you need to thread it through perfectly. So when you try to thread the soft string through it, you need to fish out the little pressed material to get the string through the two layers of the seam. This was very time consuming.<br /><br />When I was about half-way complete installing it, my wife looked at it and thought I was playing a joke on her. I understand that 'baby proofing' does require some concessions, but this looked ridicules. I tried to emphasize the good points, mostly it being the cheapest product I could find, while she quickly reminded me that our goal was to keep our child -alive- via this device and not simply save money. She demonstrated how easily the netting could be pulled up from the floor, as there is not way to vertically secure it unless you have a raised horizontal rail on the bottom of your stiles (which I do not). I couldn't argue with that logic, and was glad she pointed this out before I spent another 30min installing the remainder of the netting. The next day I returned this, as I had some -serious- doubts about its ability to keep my infant from taking a nose-dive off the 2nd floor railing.",B000056OUX,Baby_Products

Two inches doesn't really seem like that much of a difference but if I put the bottom rail at a height the little dog can't wiggle under it's short enough that the big one may try to jump or climb it.  Both are determined escape artists who detest the current necessary confinement.  Since I need a full width opening to accommodate space for myself on the stairs and the dog on a ramp l'lll either have to try and jerry-rig some kind of extender onto the top and/or bottom of this gate (spoiling the look and lines of the gate) or buy a taller (unfortunately white) one I've found, spoiling the look of the deck railing.

Needless to say she noticed the new foam corners in her toddling travels and made a B-line for them.

It had become a game for my daughter to make a grab at them any time she was near the coffee table.<br /><br />I spent more time trying to stop her from removing the Toddler Korner Kushions than enjoying the piece of mind that she wouldn't crack her head open falling into the corner of our coffee table.<br /><br />In the end we replaced the Korner Kushions with one of those padded elastic covers that wraps around the whole table.

The canopy is not removable. Also there is no mattress, just a pointless comforter type blanket that isn't safe for a baby to sleep on. I recommend buying a mattress.

1646,2.0,Very poor construction.,"Box is a great idea but the workmanship is very low quality. The wood reminds me of that light balsa wood that we used to make toy airplanes out of, when I was young. I had mine personalized and after I stained it with a very light stain, you could barely read the name. The picture on front (boy design) practically faded away. The stain, instead of bringing out a beautiful wood grain, showed the true flaws in the wood, streaky and patched. The hinge is cheap, flimsy and since the screws were put in sideways, and protruding, it does not line the top and bottom up when closed and is very loose.<br />Holes are larger than expected and the small teeth fall right out. Also, the place for umbilical cord? Not appropriate in a tooth box!<br />I love the idea but if I had seen this cheaply made box in person, I would not have purchased it.",B07BF9LMNC,Baby_Products

1648,2.0,Sloppily assembled,Was pretty dissatisfied at the lack of effort put into assembling this item for the price I paid for it. Just makes it look and feel cheap. The rolling sphere is very sloppily glued together. The seam is not even glued all the way around which will be an issue if moisture ever gets into the inside. Also has glue residue all over it. The stickers on the toys of the arch are not even put on correctly. which means they will peel off very easily. Looks like they were put on there in such a hurry that they are crooked and already bubbling up. For this thing to be something that an infant jumps up and down in I I feel like the materials and the concept are not very reliable. I get it supposed to be compact so there is not as much structural integrity with the product but I feel like if that is the case the materials it is made out of should've been a higher standard for the price. It is not an absolute waste of money but I would not pay this price point for this item at all.,B0BFWHTK29,Baby_Products

After 10 minutes I finally was able to slide it on - with much effort, but each following time has been a struggle. Even worse, this tray is absolutely a nightmare trying to slide off. It just won‚Äôt move. This is a major safety concern when you think of the possibility of your child choking and not being able to get to them as you need.

1670,2.0,Strange Extra Plastic Tray that cant be removed,This chair has this plastic tray that cant be removed. There is the tray that snaps on that you would put food and other items on and that tray has a removable part to make clean up easy. All that is fine. The odd part is that when the main try that you expect your highchair to have is removed there is anothe small plastic tray that can't be removed that makes it so that when the chair is on the lowest level your child can not get themself in and out of the chair. My 21 month old loves to climb in and out of her chair when it is on the low setting. She thinks she is helping. With this odd part there is no way she can do that with this chair and it makes it hard to get her in and out because she has long legs.

1671,2.0,"Not great if you are over 5' 3"" tall & like pillows that mold to your body & baby bump","I have had this pillow for a little over a month now.  Overall, I am disappointed in its quality of fill & length/design.  The fill is not moldable & soft, so it just keeps getting flatter and less supportive, week by week.  It wasn't that comfortable to begin with, so unlike a down or down alternative fill, you can not mold it to fit your body or baby bump.  I have to use at least 2 additional pillows to make up for the unsupportive pillow.<br /><br />I hoped this pillow would be superior to other maternity/body pillows on the market, supporting the back and proper alignment during sleep, relieving pressure. I expect a quality pillow to adjust to fit one's unique shape, curves, and sleeping position and alleviate any pressure points.<br /><br />While the increased price for the seamless pillow cover is ridiculous (they should all have a seamless cover for comfort), I'm glad I sprung for it.  Being 5' 8&#34; tall, the pillow only goes to my mid-chin, with my shoulder snugly wedged under the pullow's top arch.  If there was a seam there, it would be even more uncomfortable (as mentioned in many other reviews).<br /><br />While I am someone who has some chronic nerve pain issues that increase while pregnant, I think all pregnant mamas deserve a solid night's rest, while they can still get it.  I expected this pillow to comfortably support my head, neck, shoulders, hips, and spine so I could ditch the 4 pillows I was using before (or the scroodle noodle-like pillow).  As I mentioned above, the whole point of buying this was to have 1 pillow to wrestle, not multiple pillows!  It still takes a wrestle to find any semblance of comfort.<br /><br />If it were longer on each side and filled with a more malleable fill that could support my neck, shoulders, & bump more, I'd be in heaven.",B004W02YMG,Baby_Products

1673,2.0,"After a year of use, I'm suspicious of all these positive reviews","We've been using this diaper pail for about a year, since our little one was born. Tonight, we're putting it out with the garbage on the street. It's that bad.<br /><br />Problem #1: Clunky bag changing system<br />You'll read some reviews here that say the method for changing bags &#34;isn't that bad.&#34; Removing them isn't terribly difficult; but it's not the most elegant process, either.<br /><br />The Dekor bags are essentially long, continuous tube of plastic. To remove a &#34;bag,&#34; you gather the tube above your load of diapers and run it through a small cutting mechanism on the inside of the pail. This severs the tube, allowing you to tie off both ends, the old and the new.<br /><br />Sound confusing? Yeah, it is. And it involves tying two knots to &#34;close off&#34; the tube. I felt like a Boy Scout again. And that's not a good thing.<br /><br />And loading a new bag (again, really a giant, rolled tube) is a huge pain. My wife is better at it than me. I have yet to successfully do it.<br /><br />Problem #2: It stinks to high heaven.<br />As long as the pail is closed and the lid is shut, we don't smell a thing. But as soon as we crack the lid to deposit a diaper or open the main chamber to change the bag, a smell so potent and pervasive fills our nursery that it can hardly be believed.<br /><br />Seriously, my wife and I are flabbergasted. We've emptied it, aired it out, disinfected it with bleach and vinegar ‚Äî all to no avail. Even when empty ‚Äî with no bag inside ‚Äî the chamber smells like what I imagine the inside of a goat's rear end smells like.

It is actually quite fluffy, so it is not comfortable for little necks to lay on. In fact, my toddler could never use it because it was too fluffy and too short.  We had much better luck with a regular pillow.  I felt that was much safer because it fit the width of the bed, and he could sleep comfortably on the pillow without having to arch his neck up and hold it in one spot.  I am sure I will find a use for this if someone makes a pillow case for me, but it has overall been an unnecessary buy.",B009JV34RC,Baby_Products

I also signed up at the Dock a Tot website and they emailed me saying to post a positive review on Amazon and send it to them for a chance to win one. Then I went to the website and saw the celebrity quotes and noticed two of the quotes were exactly the same. I notified the company of this and my disappointment in their tactics to get people to buy this. I gave this two stars because even if it does work for some babies it is not worth the high price. It could very easily be made at home. My daughter would not sleep in it at all. She is 8 weeks old and has been sleeping in the bed with me but I've been afraid of rolling on her. Anyway, I was hoping she would use this to sleep in on the bed at night but no luck. I hold her until she falls asleep and put her in it and she starts tossing around until she wakes herself up. So just be aware that it might not be the miracle other reviews have made it out to be.",B018ZVIQMO,Baby_Products

He can get out the cheap version plug ins, can open baby gates, and baby proofed drawers(except the awesome magnet ones)  oh not to forget most baby proofed door contraptions.  I was really hopeful he wouldn't be able to get these out of the outlets but he got it out in 4 seconds flat. I mean the kid really should go on that minute to win it show.  Praying we don't have a life of crime ahead of us. (Sarcasism).

1692,2.0,Clicks during the day,For the price this is great for a baby camera. A couple reasons I'm giving it 3 stars though. The main reason is that the camera seems to get confused in the day time and keeps switching from day vision to night vision...which wouldnt be a problem if it didnt make a clicking noise. My baby is a pretty light sleeper. Also even with the motion detector off the camera moves. Which is just annoying.<br /><br />Update and taking away a star... it is now resetting randomly and waking up my baby because of the loud sound it makes. I guess you get what you pay for.

1696,2.0,"""Absolutely way too 'wobbly' (excessive movement)""","With the additional extension corrected, the entire unit was absolutely way too ""wobbly"" (excessive movement).<br /><br />Difficult time with installation: Issue was once I had the 4 adjusters right (pressed against the 2 walls), the door would rub against the bottom frame, making it difficult to open and close the gate. IF I were to adjust the gate to where I can now open and close the gate freely, the entire unit was now just too loose and can be knocked down with minimum force (a small dog or a 1 year old probably could push down the gate)",B003VNKLHK,Baby_Products
1697,2.0,Good quality; unsafe headrest,"The overall quality is good.  The only shortcoming, which is very significant, is the unsafe headrest/head cushion.  I found it impossible to put my daughter into a comfortable position over a period of 2 months as she grew.  The headrest pushes the baby's head forward and down, chin to the chest, which risks collapsing the throat especially in preemies and newborns.<br /><br />If using this seat, I strongly recommend going to Chicco's website and purchasing the insert for the regular Keyfit 30, and swapping out at least the headrest/head cushion portion.  Unfortunately it's another $20 on top of an expensive purchase, but the change in comfort and safety for the baby is immediate.

1700,3.0,Works okay but not worth it,"Our first diaper genie broke after one bag change (it would not close at all) so we got a replacement for free. The new one works fine, however it doesn‚Äôt hold nearly as many diapers as I would have expected it to. I have a 5 week old and we change him roughly 12-15 times a day, and I‚Äôm literally changing the bag out every day. If I would have known it‚Äôd fill up so quickly, I wouldn‚Äôt have wasted my money on this. These are also annoying to change the bags on, as it‚Äôs just one super long bag. So you need scissors and to tie the bottom when changing it. It doesn‚Äôt take long to do now, but it did take a little bit to get used to, and it is a hassle.<br /><br />I suggest the Munchkin Pail over this, as we have one of those upstairs. Their bags hold wayyyy more diapers. I change it every 3ish days and it holds up great. The munchkin pail refills are also much easier, as you just snap it into place and simply remove and snap shut once done. No cutting or tying or fighting with the thing.<br /><br />This pail gets the job done, but I personally wouldn‚Äôt recommend this or buy one again. Just not worth the money.

It's not nearly as nice as the Britax, but also much cheaper.  We were willing to live with some compromises, since it was going to be our secondary car seat.  However, the car seat's fabric was problematic enough that we ended up returning it.  Our son (who is under 2) ends up a sweaty mess every time we take him out of this car seat.  Our son is a sweaty boy in general, but he doesn't normally come out nearly this sweaty with the Britax.  The fabric doesn't seem to be breathable, and feels a bit plastic-y.  I'm sure that makes it super easy to clean.  Other than that, I thought this car seat would've been a great value at the sale price that we got it for.",B00H8MSEWY,Baby_Products

1704,3.0,Would be great if not for one major flaw,"This toy is a great size, shape, and texture for a baby.  It's design flaw is that the bristles very quickly collect lint, hairs, fuzzies, etc while it is being played with or stored against anything made of fabric (diaper bag, pocket, small organizing pouch, etc).  My son will be playing with it for 5 minutes and I will find it COVERED in every fiber he could possibly pick up in his vicinity.  I don't own pets and vaccuum often but I have 3 kids and can't provide the sterile space this toy requires not turn into a hairy monster.  I know exposure to innocuous bacteria is beneficial but I personally can't stomach watching my baby suck on a banana shaped hairbrush/lint roller.

Instead of it being two seconds reach down and open like my Munchkin gate, I have to use both hands and fumble and mess with it. Every. Single. Time. I waited a few days of using it to see if it was operator error, but even my husband and co-workers commented on how hard the new gate was to use. I have caught myself not completely shutting it because it is just too hard. The husband threw the box away, so I will have to keep it, but will probably get sick of it and buy a different style.<br /><br />I love giving 5 star reviews and wish I could have.

They don't like sleeping in it at all, perhaps because of the opaque sides that they were not used to. So... it's now a convenient laundry hamper for our bedroom, waiting for the day that a friend has a baby and we can give it away.

Biggest issue was that the p‚Äôn‚Äôp was set the the bassinet height, giving you just a few inches between the kids face a the cover. So when he threw his arms up or kicked he would keep waking himself up as he kept touching the cover. May sound weird but the zip up closure seems really loud.

The thing I really didn't like, though, is that all 4 placemats come folded together. You have to take all four out of the package, unfold, remove 1, and then retold the others and put them back in.

There was an instance I had while shopping that while trying to put the baby back into their carrier I almost knocked the whole carrier off the stroller because its not held on unless it is buckled in.

1726,3.0,Dekor Plus VS. Diaper Genie II,"So far it gets 3 stars for average and I haven't returned it yet!<br /><br />I recently purchased a Diaper Dekor Plus as an ""upgrade"" to the Diaper Genie II.<br /><br />For anyone who is looking into the Dekor Plus, and possibly changing from the Diaper Genie II, here's what I've found so far:<br /><br />As far as odor is concerned, they are comparable. I think they both contain odor well until the pail is very full or over full! The Diaper Genie contains odor a little better when dropping diapers in since the Dekor opens up to all the diapers in the bin. So far, I haven't noticed a significant difference in the size of the opening like I thought I would and had read! Yeah, I don't like ""stuffing"" yucky poopy diapers, especially once baby starts solids, so that was the downside with the Diaper Genie but usually only had the problem once it got full. But I do know that it gets worse once diaper size goes up (I've used a diaper genie over 11 years with 3 babies). And the larger the diaper, the quicker the Diaper Genie gets full. Their refills are so expensive and I was only getting about 2 ""full loads"" from each refill on only size 1 & 2 diapers. The dekor seems to hold far more diapers and so far the ONLY real plus over the Diaper Genie. One thing I hate with the Dekor is the ""trap door"", or the part that you insert the diaper into. It's snappy! It's snapped my hand or fingers a few times. I wish when you used the petal, it would also open since it opens downward into the pail and the lid obviously up. Not sure how the designer(s) of this product failed to consider that. When I saw that there was a knob, I thought it would be for that purpose but it's not. You can only lock it (I guess so a young curious child doesn't get their hand caught). But they could have used the same principle so that you could lock it to avoid little curious hands  while making it unlock for PARENTS that are using it by having the thing open while pressing the petal. If the diaper is heavy enough, it'll fall in, but if not, it's a two-hand job or it gets your hand. And once you've dumped a very full poopy diaper and are still wiping, the Dekor ""door"" can get poop on it. One might think, ""well, use both hands!"" but infants are wiggly and I'm usually busy trying to hold my daughter's feet or legs or both from getting into the mess while disposing at the same time.<br /><br />I like how the Dekor opens for changing the bag but I think the Diaper Genie is sleeker and looks less like a trash can or diaper pail. I'm going to give it a bit more time, I'm still using the bag the Dekor came with (but for all I know it might run out tomorrow and I got refills just in time!) and see how it goes over the next month and possibly one refill. Sometimes I feel like what it comes with is a tease and the refills aren't as good or won't hold as much as this first one. Since you can buy 100 tall kitchen bags so inexpensively, I thought I'd go that route. I thought the Dekor Plus had this option for the diaper pail but I *think* it's only if you want to turn it into a regular trash can and I don't see using it as a trash can. I suppose if I knew for sure we were planning on more babies, this might be a good option to use in the baby's room in between babies but otherwise, more than likely I wouldn't be using it as a trash can. It must have been another pail that had the refill or regular kitchen bag option for diapers but this was one of the reasons I chose to ditch the Genie and go Dekor. I will look into it again though and see if it can be used as a pail with regular bags.<br /><br />One final mention on the Diaper Genie. I was beginning to have repeated problems with the lid's plastic hinges popping out of place and thus making the pail unusable. Seems like when it got too full, the lid would come unhinged (the petal would no longer open the lid). When it first happened I thought it was broken but I was able to snap things back into place (this is hard to describe unless you know what I'm talking about). And it was becoming a regular problem and a lot of times I would have a big ol' yucky diaper and dirty wipes in the dirty diaper containment area????? (the part before the mechanism that opens and drops the diaper into the pail). The ""trap"" wouldn't open to drop the diaper into the pail until it was completely fixed and the foot petal worked again. I'd have to open the pail like I would to change the bag, pull the bag down, pull out the refill (and all of this was wasting liner), and in the process sometimes the bad diaper would fall out or I'd have to take it out (FUN!!!!!!) or try and contain it while I changed the bag and then snapping the lid back into place so that the foot petal would open the lid again, which would then open the trap that drops the diaper into the pail. None of this probably makes sense but that's about how confusing and frustrating it is!",B00005V6C8,Baby_Products

However, after just a few washes, they started feeling sticky and the draw string had trouble closing because of this.  I thought it had to do with my wash routine but after trying several changes, nothing made a difference.  They each get used 1-2 times a week and washed every two to four uses and now after three months of use, the seams have started splitting and I haven't been hard on them at all.

1731,3.0,"Needs better tether storage, otherwise would have been 5 star","We have two Sunshine Kids Radian 80 seats, a Britax Marathon, and this Britax Boulevard.<br /><br />Britax Pros:  seats look comfy, cover is easy to remove, harness straps pretty easy to adjust, integrated lock-offs make it easy to get the car seats in & out of the vehicle<br /><br />Britax Cons:  Storage for excess top tether strap stinks.  It has an elastic strap that looks really handy initially, but the webbing slips out of it really easily and it isn't really stretch enough to get a couple wraps.  The pouch doesn't really keep just the excess (it's a big floppy wide mouthed pouch that according to the manual is intended for storing the entire tether when it's not in use - although if you call with a complaint about it, Britax will tell you that you should have been using the pouch all along and reference a bunch of statements in the manual that don't actually say anything about that) and is in a spot that gets jostled a lot in my minivan.<br /><br />The big kicker:  if the strap comes undone and slips out the door without you noticing immediately (easy to happen with a big minivan door, rear facing seat, and black strap - especially at night), there is a significant chance your seat will be totally ruined and you'll have to buy a new one (if the red stitches on the tether tear at all when the tether gets yanked around in the door they say you have to treat it like it was in an accident - meaning no repair parts).  It happens often enough that as soon as I started to tell the customer service rep that the end of the tether had gotten damaged when tangled up in the door, she started right into a pretty pat spiel about how if I'd driven with the tether stuck out I'd need to throw the seat away and go purchase a new one - before she even asked me if I had, or told me I could inspect if any stitching had torn (which it hadn't - it was just snagged up at the very end where it got tangled).  Our Sunshine Kids seats have a nice plastic compartment integrated into the top of the seat that has a little tab to help hold in the roll of extra webbing and works very well for keeping the excess tucked away, so I expected something equal from the Britax in the same price range.  At the very least, make the strap brightly colored so that it's noticeable.<br /><br />On the Britax, skip the pouch & built in elastic right from the get-go and get your own rubber band instead and then tuck it somewhere in the middle of your car just in case your rubber band comes undone.  Otherwise just skip the seat altogether, because it's not worth paying $250 twice to have one functional seat at the end.",B003OUWINA,Baby_Products

My 8 month old still doesn't sleep well on it compared to how well he sleeps in the basinett or pack n play, he seems uncomfortable and doesn't stay asleep long. The water resistant cover is also difficult to get on and off, with an awkward elastic strap that has to be positioned across the middle of the mattress.

It is rated very high on Consumer Reports and the Baby Bargains book.  When you purchase the seat the bottom/seat strap is in the smaller setting, and it is very difficult to change it to the larger setting.  But once it's there you don't have to change it any more.

However, they barely lasted 2 hours and it's been 2 weeks now with them up and I haven't seen a single one glow after. I've tried to keep curtains and windows open, I've left the ceiling light on, and it just doesnt seem to be enough for these guys to absorb.

1756,3.0,Does what it is supposed to,"I received this today and headed out with my boy for a walk. It is easy to figure out how it works and does what it is intended to do, provide shade for your child. I used it on a simple umbrella stroller. I set it up to completely shade my son and we were off. There was a small amount of wind and the umbrella held up fine for this small amount. (The wind did blow it over, but I believe this was due to the clamp not being fully tightened - One thing I did notice is you really have to tighten this really tight, I hope the plastic will hold up to the amount of torque necessary to keep it in place)<br /><br />At our first corner, I had to remove the clamp and relocate it to the other side of the stroller to once again completely cover my son. Due to amount of torque needed to refasten the clamp at each relocation, this product should come with two clamps. The umbrella comes out of the clamp with a push of a button so having an extra clamp would make it easy to go from side to side.<br /><br />CONS: Having to move the umbrella from side to side all the time is a pain (If a second clamp was provided I would have given this 5 stars. I'm worried about the longevity of the clamp after continually changing the side it is affixed to).<br /><br />PROS: It provides the shade necessary when placed on the correct side of the stroller<br />- Allows plenty of air to keep baby cool.<br />- No metal tips to poke baby (the tips are rounded plastic)<br /><br />I will try and update this review after more use.<br /><br />I will be looking into getting another clamp.<br />(Found the clamp on their website - $10 plus shipping)<br /><br />Also noticed that their website indicates it will not work on Kolcraft Umbrella strollers.

This has a very stiff and bulky inside layer of plastic surrounded by a cloth exterior.  They are not easy to turn inside out to clean.  It takes way too much effort to clean out the inside corners if you're using this for food.  I could fit 2 small sandwiches in it, but I think I'll be using this for something other than food from now on.  This isn't the same construction as the Planetwise wet bags that you'd use for cloth diapering.",B00G4CLAVG,Baby_Products
1792,3.0,It works but not my favorite,We ended up just using the pitcher with the Prince Lionheart formula mixer when we need to make bottles in advance. The Dr. Brown's pitcher defiinitely works but it is kind of clumsy and for me annoying to take apart the top pieces each time I use it. I prefer a more automated way to mix the powder formula especially because we use an organic soy powder which is difficult to dissolve and is often clumpy. I prefer the Kidsline Baby Chef flawless formula maker - an awesome automated way to make the formula and heat it up for immediate use.,B0C4W7L1S6,Baby_Products
1793,3.0,Works only if your cords emerge straight from their bases that are plugged into the outlets,"The LectraLock has a few design issues that make me regret having purchased more than one of them before testing it.<br /><br />(1) LectraLock only works for cords with bases that send the cord in a straight line from the outlet, like those in the seller's first photo of the product. Unfortunately, many cords these days--including the majority of surge protectors and power strips--are designed with the cord emerging sideways from the base that's plugged in to the outlet so as to minimize the chance of something bumping and unplugging the cord. If you plan to plug in anything with a cord that emerges from the plug in any direction but straight out, either (1) the base of the cord will protrude from where the edge of the LectraLock is designed to snap in to the outlet cover (i.e., you won't be able to use the cover at all), or (2) you'll have to plug the device into the farther socket, in which case the device's cord will block the second socket and you'll only be able to use one socket with the LectraLock in place over the outlet. In other words, the Lectralock does not leave enough space for a cord emerging at, say, a right angle to be plugged into the outlet while at the same time leaving the other outlet free. (See the photo I posted with the LectraLock cover off due to the brown cord, which is designed to emerge from the outlet at a 90-degree angle.)<br /><br />(2) Even for cords that do emerge straight from the outlet, the cover does require you to bend many cords--particularly thick ones--in a V shape, often with the part of the cord leaving the outlet touching the part of the cord headed back toward the LectraLock's side holes, which tugs enough at the plug such that it begins to come out of the outlet. (See the photo I posted with the LectraLock cover on.)<br /><br />Ultimately, this cover will work for some users, but make sure in advance that the outlet with which you plan to use it either only has one cord running to it or doesn't have a cord that emerges from its base downward, upward, or to the left or right.",B009UX0NBO,Baby_Products

1798,3.0,"Well built, BUT inconsistent design","No doubt this is a high quality product. However, there is one particular ""feature"" (you could actually call it design flaw)in it, that had it been better specified in the product description my wife and I would had probably bought a different stroller.<br /><br />The cameleon3 does not lock when collapsed. Why? because they have this ""really cool feature"" where you can open it with a single hand. That of course if you can take it out of your car without messing it up with BOTH hands. It makes no sense to me, when all the other functions on this stroller need to be performed with BOTH hands (remove the car seat, remove the car seat adapter*, and of course collapse it), why bother making this change from the previous cameleon? Then, when traveling, you will probably be forced to buy a travel bag or come up with a way to strap it secure. Otherwise, expect a broken stroller when you come out of your plane.<br /><br />This is a large and heavy unit, if you decide to buy it please be careful and watch your fingers (the same message I received from their customer service).<br /><br />Good luck with your baby!<br /><br />*Depending on the car seat model (for the Chicco you need both hands).",B00C6AY6FC,Baby_Products

I love how completely the spout closes, how the cap screws on to perfect alignment every time.<br /><br />So, why three stars?

1803,4.0,It was great for traveling with our 6-month-old twins,"It was great for traveling with our 6-month-old twins. Durable, easy to inflate, and deep enough to get the job done. The thing that's not clear from the description (I should have ready the question / answer section instead) - is that your baby really, really needs to be able to sit up by herself. That's why it indicates &#34;6-months&#34; as the minimum age. Ours can sit with assistance but not alone. This made for a very precarious and slippery situation. I was hoping that the saddle horn would help keep them sitting like our normal baby tub does. However, this tub forces them to sit up tall with the horn, and the sides are kind of spongy when inflated, so they were kind of leaning around a bit. It was fine once I got a hand on them (one at a time, didn't put both in the tub, not enough room), but I was hoping to be able to use both hands for washing. This will be great once they can sit up though!",B0C41H8L7P,Baby_Products

There should be precise directions, after you cut the hook off the cardboard it came on, to fix it precisely, through the extra metal Loop, so that the velcro stays tight. I can't figure it out. Other than that it's great! So convenient. Definitely better than trying to carry bags in my hands as I'm walking with a walker.",B00VU8B0W8,Baby_Products
1805,4.0,its great. Making a bottle at 2,"Decided to leave a review after all the positive and negative reviews all over the place.<br /><br />This machine is definitely a luxury item and not a necessity. With that in mind, its great. Making a bottle at 2:00 AM while holding an infant is a breeze with this thing. I like to put a bottle in, start the machine and start grabbing a bib and the bottle parts to put together. The best part about this is for babysitting. Have some one coming to your house to watch the baby? Now you dont have to explain how to mix your formula. They just have to hit a button.<br /><br />The reason I left four stars and not five? The machine requires cleaning. Not a big deal, however, if you dont keep up with it, it can produce some weak formula. The manual stresses how often you have to clean but i think if you went by their cleaning schedule it would take up too much time. I have found cleaning the power tub once a week, the water jug every two weeks is fine. On a daily basis, I take out the powder tub(leaving it intact) and wipe the area where the metered formula is dispensed. Once you figure out your cleaning ritual, you'll love it.",B00E8KJYNC,Baby_Products

1817,4.0,Easy to get around on even ground,"I have 3 kids and tried my fair share of strollers over the years. Single strollers, double strollers, wagon strollers, you name it. My middle child and oldest son is autistic, nonverbal and a runner. He likes to take off and run away so we still use strollers with him and his younger brother to keep him safe. Even though he is old enough to walk. He's 4. This stroller is one of the few double strollers which is rated for kids up to 50 lbs each. Which is perfect and means we will be able to use it for him for a while. It is really easy to push and get around. My biggest pet peeve is that the front wheels are small and easily get stuck on uneven sidewalks and in potholes. Which gets really annoying and is hard to maneuver especially with two older (4yo & 2yo) kids in the stroller. It folds down slim enough to fit in the back of our Honda Pilot with all 3 rows up. Which the Evenflo Pivot Xplore does not. You can also easily fold it down with one hand which is huge if you have several kids to lug around. The boys enjoy sitting next to each other instead of across like in a wagon stroller and they are able to use the sun canopies to get their ""own space"" when they don't want to deal with the other.",B07NRVZPD8,Baby_Products

1821,4.0,Great for monthly's!,"I thought I'd share a somewhat unusual use I found for these. I'd bought the fruit punch flavor to try and while the flavor is pretty fake and way too sweet, when you need them it's not too bad, kind of zippy actually. I actually like the unflavored version too. Bought in a bottle for my cats who have kidney issues. Can't give them the flavored stuff though, but my friends won't drink the unflavored so I wanted something else on hand.<br />Well, here's what I discovered. If you are female and have severe water retention issues you may have woken up some mornings during that time of the month to discover that even though you ached all over from retention swelling, you also were desperately thirsty and feeling headachy, nauseous and water just didn't cut it, no matter how much you drank. Sounds a bit familiar? Maybe to those who've had a hangover. I've never had one of those, but this feeling reminded me suspiciously of descriptions I'd heard, so having these on hand I thought I'd give one a try.<br />Well, I found out that even sipping at a cup of this stuff really helps a lot. Drink one 8 ounce glass and I'm good for the day. My energy level returns from the basement, my headache clears up, my nausea is nearly gone and I ache less as well. My appetite improves and I feel like I can think again and am not going to be forced to kill anyone inadvertently if they try to talk to me. Excellent stuff. It doesn't help with other symptoms, sadly, but then it's not meant for that. But, since it seems that severe monthly water retention also results in symptoms of dehydration, (Presumably because the fluids aren't being made available as they would normally.) this really helps with that hangover feeling that can result, particularly in the morning, and especially if you've slept in while attempting to help with other issues and haven't been able to have normal meals or fluids.<br />Anyway, just wanted to mention it in case anyone else might find it helpful. Since discovering this fact, I've resorted to it on several occasions when my monthly's were being especially obnoxious and it's helped hugely with that particular problem every time. Thank goodness something does!",B0C3WTS26C,Baby_Products

1824,4.0,A good choice for 2 sided protection after a comparison with 3 other bed rails,"Due to the room layout, I needed a double bed rail that would protect both sides of the bed.  We don't live near a store that has a lot of choices and after reading many online product descriptions decided that we were going to need to look at several of these ""in person"" and then decide which one best fit our needs.  So we purchased 4 brands of bed rails.<br /><br />After looking at the more detailed information on the box and trying two of them out, we decided to keep the Safe and Secure Double Bedrail by the First Years.<br /><br />To help others, I have attached two customer's photos to this product description.  These photos are sketches and photos from the side of the box that better describe the bed rail.  Why amazon/Target can't get a least as much information on their website than is on the side of the box is frustrating to me.  But that seems to happen many times.<br /><br />This bedrail took about 30 minutes to assemble the side panels and another 45 minutes to fully assemble the unit to the bed.  This is in line with the time that the other model we tried out took.<br /><br />The reasons why we liked this bed rail the best are as follows:<br /><br />(1) It is a double bed rail and is designed to protect both sides of the bed.<br /><br />(2) This was the only model we looked at where both sides folded down making mattress pad and sheet changes feasible.<br /><br />(3) The quality of the construction (especially of the spring loaded Locking Pins) was much better than that of the Sleeptite bed rail we looked at from Regalo and One Step Ahead (which is also made by Regalo.)<br /><br />(4) The design made more sense than the Regalo.  The installation was more straightforward.<br /><br />Possible issues with this bed rail are as follows:<br /><br />(1) It is only 17"" high, so measure your mattress and make sure that it will fit.  In our case, our mattress was not a pillowtop and is about 10-11"" high, depending on where you measure it.  So we were still satisfied with the height of the rail above our mattress.  But I could see where if you had a tall mattress this would be an issue.<br /><br />(2) This was the easiest rail to pull up to unlock and fold down.  Others had more substantial locking mechanisms.  I could see where a toddler who watched you do this, could then do it himself.  So we are planning on not doing this in front of our toddler, only during sheet changes.  Only you know how inquisitive your own child is about these things and how much of a problem this would be.<br /><br />Despite these two issues, we decided that the good points outweighed the bad and that this bedrail was the best choice for us.  However, if we are later disappointed with this bed rail, I will go and update our review.",B0002JA4XC,Baby_Products

1830,4.0,Perfect for travel or grandma's house.,"This chair is perfect for what we use it for, weekends at grandma's. The chair doesn't appear to be the most comfortable chair in the world, just hard plastic and no padding. But, it works well for the weekends when we use it and is wipes clean easily. Because I keep this at grandma's, I don't take it traveling with me but if I had one at my house I would take it to restaurants and such with me because it is more secure (and clean) than the generic wood restaurant highchairs. The back rest folds down, so it is a little more compact for travel. With the adjustable chair back and bottom straps, it fits snugly and securely to chairs.<br /><br />My daughter is currently 11 months old and I did not purchase this until she could sit upright on her own, so I cannot really speak to use before this stage. However, the back sits very upright and does not recline, so I couldn't imagine that you could really use it until they were fairly stable sitters.<br /><br />I would give it 5 stars if there was padding/insert to make it a little more comfy.

1842,4.0,My 6mo loves it,Both boys (6mo and 17mo) really like it. My toddler plays with the toys when he's near it and the baby loves to jump around in it and likes to play with the octopus section.<br />Only downfall is that it takes up a good bit of space ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Worth it though.,B0C44G65XR,Baby_Products
1843,4.0,Positives outway the negative,This potty is a life saver for my daughter in the middle of the night. It took her a couple of times going up and down to master it. It is a bit wobbly and the seat is shaped  different from my toilet seat so if my daughter doesn't sit all the way back urine will get on the floor.  Other then that this is a great product and it is super easy to fold and clean,B07FKSHNNB,Baby_Products

1845,4.0,Great carrier backpack but may take time to calibrate adjustments.,"Needed to upgrade my kid carrier backpack since my son outgrew our initial carrier. I bought this product based on the ratings and Osprey Poco being mentioned multiple times on online articles/videos for best carrier backpacks. Provided instructions are simple to follow for set up and adjustments.<br /><br />Used the carrier for the first time on 17 Oct 2020 for both my 3 year old daughter (near 40 pounds) and my 1.5 year son (near 25 pounds). Noticed no strain/pain in my upper or mid back; however, there was pain around my waist and lower back. My daughter is near or exceed the weight limit, so this could be a factor in the experienced pain. I will need to tweak adjusting the straps to figure out how to alleviate the waist/lower back pain.<br /><br />Overall, happy with this carrier backpack.",B081L9CF53,Baby_Products

Only issue so far is that the eyelets on the side - for the strap of the changing pad to go through is a bit small and it is therefore very difficult to get the straps through. Especially if you would like to take it off once a week or so to wash. When I put it on I was scared i would rip them as it was so tight. Other than that, time will tell how well the waterproof part of it holds up etc.",B07D72K7J2,Baby_Products

It is my first pregnancy pillow so I don‚Äôt have anything to compare it to, but I‚Äôm very happy with my purchase. The only reason I have it four stars is bc it is hard to sleep with bc it hurts my neck and I have to use it with a regular pillow which therefore provides less back support.

1853,4.0,Just ok,"Just got this set for my 16mo. They're fine, but I'm a little disappointed. They are very light weight, almost to the point of being difficult to use. There's no prop on the bottom, so the utensil lays directly on the counter/plate. While this isn't a huge hassle, it's definitely frustrating if you're still at the stage of loading the spoon or fork for your kiddo. The backs of the handles are also white which just feels a little cheap.<br /><br />We'll keep using them, but I'll look around for better options.",B07KKGV2RX,Baby_Products
1854,4.0,Great for Cloth Diapers,"About a month in, and this sprayer works really well. It was pretty easy to install with just a pair of adjustable pliers (Channelocks). Well, my toilet had a non-flexible hose on it that I had to replace also, but that wasn't a big deal. The water pressure is fantastic, and that might be my only quibble with it. It might actually be TOO powerful. That's easily remedied, though, with the adjustable lever. Also, holding the diaper a littler lower and closer to the water helps minimize splatter.",B01N5R8ATI,Baby_Products
1855,4.0,Just OK,"Overall a nice product. Two major things that i don't like are:<br />1> the rear wheels don't swivel.  It makes getting around more difficult for an infant just learning to use his/her legs.<br />2> The tray in front has a nice snap in entertainment center.  The problem is, there's too many nooks and crannies for droll and food to get stuck into.It's hard to clean and is not waterproof.  The good thing is that it comes off easily so you can toss it in the trash can like I did.<br /><br />On a positive note, it's doing exactly what I bought it for.  My 7 month old is now mobile and exploring the house on his own.<br /><br />The quality of this one is better than all the other ones out there.  This one is also more expensive, but worth it.  I'd classify this one as barely acceptable.  And all the other ones cheap poorly built junk.",B000WOV7WO,Baby_Products
1856,4.0,Not quite as comfortable as I'd hoped,"My old high back office chair got old and lost its padding, then I lost weight and lost mine. Being short, I tend to sit further forward in the chair in order to reach my laptop comfortably so my thighs were resting on the front edge/frame of the chair, with my legs all but falling sleep. I'd hoped that this cushion would alleviate that, but the dense foam is rather unforgiving on the front edge, so I still find even the cushion gouging the back of my legs and them getting tingly after extended sitting. It's probably a matter of personal preference, but I thought it would be a little squishier, like the memory foam in my shoes. OTOH, my chair has lost its piston action, so it's too low and this cushion does a good job of get me to a better height. I may consider using this for my car instead, since I need height there and I don't sit as long as when I'm working. The other issue I have is that the back strap isn't long enough to go around the back of the ""executive"" chair. That's not a big issue, because it doesn't really slide. All in all, it's a nice cushion, just not quite what I'd expected.",B092ZWGJTP,Baby_Products

Only 4 stars out of 5 given because I think the manufacturer should pad the side rails or raise the age limit a little.

1863,4.0,Best product for nursing thus far,"I have already been nursing for 3 months and I am still having a difficult time with my daughter being able to latch.  I tried just about everything out there to help with nursing.  I tried the Boppy, but my daughter would fall into the hole in the middle which made it difficult to line her head up appropriately for nursing.  The Boppy also squished together a lot and over time I know it would not hold up.  Also, I had to be very careful while using the Boppy because she could easier roll off of it.<br /><br />I also tried a foam c shaped pillow by Kushies and that didn't allow her head to line up either because I had to put burp cloths under her head to lift it higher.<br /><br />My Brest Friend works the best because it has two bumps (one on each side) on the top of the pillow that line up with each breast.  These bumps lift her head up perfectly and help align her with my breast.  Also, the top of the pillow has a lot of surface area and so I know I will be able to use this even when she is over a year old.  Next, it has a nice back support pillow. In addition, I like the feel of the fabric and the little pocket.<br /><br />I only gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because I always have to put a small pillow or blanket under it in order to lift the pillow up to the appropriate height.",B002WGI5O8,Baby_Products

I would, however, invest in covers for the pad.  We didn't for our first child, and the pad got cracked and dirty.  Although the covers I have now do not fit very well, I like that they make the pad a little more comfortable and easier to clean.

1928,5.0,Great product but you should know...,"I do love this product but there are a few things about it I should mention.<br /><br />1. There is a timer and it does run via power cord or battery as described BUT the vibration setting connected to the seat is a separate device and requires batteries.  It is not connected to the timer either.  This was not a deal breaker I just felt like the description was misleading.<br /><br />2. The music/nature sounds are horrible.  The music is high pitched dinging that faintly resembles a few classical tunes.  The nature sounds are just static and white noise.  It sounds like nothing.  Both are really loud and can be turned down but, in my opinion, not enough.<br /><br />However, I still give 5 stars because these were not deal breakers for us and even if I would have known these things ahead of time I still would have gladly purchased this item.  We simply wanted a swing that is compact and light for around $100 and this glider is perfect.  The base is set inward so it takes up as little room as possible while remaining stable and I easily carry it from 2nd floor to basement and back which I do almost daily.  It is much better that those A-frame swings in size and mobility.  Hope this helps.",B00AO083KU,Baby_Products

I held off on writing a review until we had the need to wash and dry it (we use a pillow case on it, so not planning to wash/dry the actual pillow unless it‚Äôs necessary).  I have to admit, I was definitely wary of putting it through the washer and dryer.  I washed it on the delicate cycle, but it was just soaking wet and sooo heavy at the end.  So I put it through a setting on my washer ‚ÄòDrain and Spin‚Äô  which uses the heaviest spin cycle, where as the gentle cycle uses the lightest spin cycle . Then into the dryer on low heat. Came out like a brand new pillow!! So pleased!  We are taking a vacation next week and his pillow will definitely be coming with him!",B0BQ1FX6T7,Baby_Products

Somewhere to hook toys onto<br />5. Fits Costco cart (it does easily!)<br /><br />This has all of that and more. I was pleasantly surprised to see the little elastic cup holder on the inside of it. The orange hooks for the toys slide back and forth which is fun.

1936,5.0,Perfect!,"Exactly what I was looking for, this gate is perfect. I was hoping for something which swivels and expands, so that I can use it across both a hallway and a staircase (of course, not at the same time).  I contacted the company and for an additional $25 I purchased an additional mounting kit so I had two connection points.  As a bonus, I was even able to install it so that it folds neatly against a blank wall when not in use!  Works just fine to contain my dogs too!<br /><br />This gate works great, looks good, and is pretty solid.  Don't believe the reviewers who say it's cheap or &#34;sticky&#34;, I attribute those to poor installation.  If you take the time to line things up and install it correctly (which is not hard, just takes attention to details and basic handyman skills) then the gate should work fine.",B003TXN2XM,Baby_Products

1938,5.0,The BEST diaper bag!,"So far I am loving this diaper bag!! It's really comfy to wear, even when it's stuffed full. I have been wearing my son in the ergo baby and wearing this on my back, it works great!<br /><br />It has so many pockets to organize stuff in! I love the wipes pocket so I can reach the wipes without taking the backpack off. The insulated pocket is great for water bottles. It's a really tight squeeze, but I can fit two 16.9 fl oz Kirkland Signature bottles of water in it. There are two extra pockets behind those two on the outside that I use one for diapers and the other for a couple bottles. My full size wallet fits in both the top and bottom outside pockets. I put a bib and hand sanitizer in the middle outside pocket and it works great for when I need those quickly! The inside has a nice sleeve for the changing pad, two inner pockets that I use for extra clothes, and a little zip pocket for smaller items. There is a ton of space still in the middle of the big pocket that I keep blankets and a medicine bag in with room to spare.<br /><br />The stroller clips on the bag are fantastic, I use them for both our strollers and shopping carts. They are adjustable so they could fit on a bunch of sizes of handles. The changing pad that comes with it is also awesome! It's thick and has an easy material to wipe down. The little bag it comes with fits a bottle, water bottle, and the on the go packets of formula perfectly so I am able to grab that for a quick feed.<br /><br /> The only thing that I would change about this bag is that I wish it was waterproof. It is water resistant enough that running from the car to the store in the pouring rain everything was fine though, so I'm fine that it's not! Overall this bag is amazing and well worth the money! It seems sturdy so I do expect it to hold up for a while. We are traveling with baby in early November and expect this to work great on our flights and at Disneyland!",B07DXT4KVY,Baby_Products

I find it sweet and was a nice touch this company did for their costumers.üíü Plus with all the free stuff came with the bag- stroller hook, changing mat, small matching purse,  and a strap so you can use it as a messenger bag. All I can say is wow! With ither diaper bags you have to buy those separate! Whoever designed this bag, have know all the needs and wish of a parent their diaper bag must have. If I counted it right, it has 16 pockets over all, big and small. I love the front 2 zipper pocket,  I use it as a mommy space. It fits my wristlet wallet, small make-up purse, my keys, checkbook and still have extra room.  I'm due with my 3rd child next month, I have 5 and 3yrs old.

Holy cow I wish I would have done this sooner. It completely ended her accidents and she is 100% out of pull-ups. Within a month or so, she didn't need these anymore! If you are thinking about getting these, DO IT!!! Don't second guess yourself. They are super absorbent and comfortable. They wash up nicely, but sometimes you need to dry them a bit longer because of the thickness, some spots are still damp.

1945,5.0,Great monitor!,"I love this baby monitor.  We recently replaced an older monitor that had constant static issues with this Summer model, and I can't say enough good things about it.  1) It is digital and automatically selects the clearest channel.  We have almost never heard static over this monitor and the automatic channel selection means you don't have to fiddle with buttons on both the monitor and receiver to align the channels. This does however make the monitor cut out for ~5 sec. when it does need to scan the channels.  2) The volume buttons beep when you push them.  Some people may not like this, but I love it since the background on the monitor is so quiet, it allows me to know for sure that I have adjusted the volume up or down as I want.  Also, since I carry the monitor around on my pants alot, it allows me to verify if I accidently adjust the volume as I bump into something. 3) The battery lasts all day and there is a convenient clip for carrying the monitor with you around the house. 4) It has lights equivalent to the sound output, so if you're doing a noisy task such as vacumming, you can still be sure to know if baby is making any noise.<br /><br />Some other reviewers have complained about the bright blue lights.  In general, I don't find them to be annoying or overly bright, the same with the beep to turn on/off or adjust volume.  These features are more helpful to me than anything.  The volume setting is &#34;remembered&#34; every time you turn it on & off.  This may not seem like a big deal, but it allows me to turn the monitor off in the middle of the night when I get up with the baby and to turn it back on, knowing it is at an appropriate volume (loud enough to wake me, not so loud as to scare me awake).  This is a wonderful feature for not waking anyone else in the room, and something our old monitor did not allow for.",B004HWDMV6,Baby_Products

1950,5.0,Great little stroller,"**UPDATE: I changed the review to 5 stars. I still really like this stroller and I use it almost every day out in my back yard. I've used it on regular walks, at the store, and as i said, the boardwalk, along with my yard and in my stone driveway. It maneuvers just fine and has held up great, though I don't abuse my strollers. I don't really fold this up much anymore because I use it daily, so the fact that I can't fold it one handed just is so minor for me. Still completely recommend this stroller.<br /><br />So far I have only used this twice and I love it. Its exactly what I wanted. I wanted it because its more than an umbrella stroller but not a heavy full size stroller. Its very light weight and folds pretty compact, easy to fit in any trunk or back seat. Other reviews said that this stroller was hard to maneuver and was very hard hitting on any kind of bump even the tiny cracks in the sidewalk. I have not experienced this issue whatsoever. We used it on the boardwalk and I also pushed it around my yard today in my stone driveway and in the grass and it did perfectly fine. Some said their kids were being jolted forward at every bump, again we have not experienced this at all on either terrain type. The basket is big enough to throw in a sweatshirt or 2 and small diaper bag or purse and some toys. Thats what I wanted. The only thing I had to knock some stars off for was the ease of folding. Could be because its brand new that its just stiff, but i am unable to fold it one handed with ease. I have to lift up on the child tray often to get it to close and the wheels don't always fall into position to provide a full fold without manually turning them. It is  however, easy to unfold one handed so this issue is definitely minor, at least for us. Overall I completely recommend this stroller.",B0B8KQK86R,Baby_Products
1951,5.0,Fabulous stroller! Comfortable and very user friendly.,"Before getting this stroller, I had 2 strollers: a lightweight but uncomfortable-to-use umbrella stroller, and a traditional, clunky stroller. This stroller combines the best of those 2 types of strollers while minimizing the cons. I have an almost 3 year old who I use this primarily for, she fits great! I also have a 5 year old that fits well, though he usually prefers to walk.<br /><br />I love how comfortable this stroller is to push. It is very light weight, and the handles are high and at a comfortable level. The stroller opens very easily. There is a latch that's easy to see that just needs to be unhinged. It is easy to fold, too. Near the handles is a trigger you flip (step 1 and 2 clearly marked), then you are able to fold the stroller. It's very smooth; you don't have to fight with it at all. There's a cup holder, which is important to me, since I always seem to need one! I also love that there is a pouch between the handles. I use this to put my cellphone and keys in when I go for a walk. Perfect size and very convenient! The shade on this stroller is beautiful! It adds interest with it's unique shape, but is also very functional as it provides exceptional shade for the little passenger. There is storage underneath as well, perfect for coats or a purse. The buckles secure the child safely and easily. The materials feel like quality and I'm confident this stroller will last me a while.<br /><br />I am very pleased with this stroller! I use it for walks, trips to the zoo, shopping, travel, etc.<br /><br />I received a sample in exchange for my honest review.",B01A6N5QZE,Baby_Products

1954,5.0,Fits Graco Pack 'n Play and baby sleeps like a dream!,"We've been using a Graco brand Pack 'n Play ever since baby transitioned out of a bassinet. My son has been small for his age, so we got away with using the &#34;top level&#34; position for the included mattress for quite a while. When I realized he was over the weight limit of 15 lbs, I made the transition to the bottom level (also, you should transition to bottom level if your baby can pull up his chest with his arms tucked underneath, as if to crawl).<br /><br />I knew right away that we were going to have to get an additional mattress - it is just way too hard and uncomfortable for sleeping. NOTE: it says in the warnings never to add a mattress, and you are welcome to heed that warning. As far as I can tell, the issue with adding a mattress is that it does not fasten (with snaps and velcro) to the bottom of the Pack 'n Play. I am personally not worried about my son pulling on the mattress and unseating it - I don't think he will try, not really his personality, and I don't think it's likely he will be successful - mainly because it is a very good fit. If you are personally concerned, you could add fasteners to your sheets and loop them through the same holes the included mattress uses.<br /><br />The mattress itself is encased in vinyl, which I LOVE! The bassinet I had also had a full vinyl exterior, and it's much more convenient for cleaning than the &#34;waterproof-ish&#34; material that covers most baby gear. This also means there is no need for a &#34;waterproof mattress pad.&#34; The aftermarket sheets I bought for the original Graco mattress still fit this one, although it was a bit tight (and it looked like the mattress wasn't going to lay flat, but  it was fine once I put it in the unit). The thickness of this mattress is perfect - there are 3&#34; ones available on Amazon, but I paid 40% the price for this 2&#34; mattress (~$20 as compared to ~$50). Best of all, baby sleeps great now that we've upgraded! I couldn't be happier with my purchase.",B000G7NKXQ,Baby_Products

That‚Äôs kind of inconvenient which is why this fan is ideal for us. Battery operated and very portable. I let it get a full charge (via USB) and the next day for a test I let it run on medium with the low LED light setting. It lasted for about 15 hours straight. By my calculations for the way we use it it‚Äôll go for at least 6 days before we need to recharge it, and that‚Äôs a simple task leaving it overnight.<br />We also spend a good amount of time going to vineyards outdoors in our area and this will be a perfect addition to take along.",B0C2Q7NDZC,Baby_Products

Went through the sony, angelcare and philips to finally end up with these and I really wish we went with these in the first place.  Range is incredible (worked in a hotel from the 4th floor room down to the pool, don't worry, mom was in there sleeping too).  Sound quality is better than a phone.  Features are awesome, just wish they had a thermometer!",B00Q65V72S,Baby_Products
1966,5.0,great cups in great colors!,"These are just like any other first years take and toss cups.<br />I did not encounter this issue with this batch of cups, but if you find that liquid oozes out of the straws over time when the cup is filled with cold beverages, take a needle and poke a hole in the lid for a vent.  A needle hole will be enough to release the pressure due to the cold beverage becoming less cold over time, but too small to leak if your toddler knocks the cup over (at least from the hole you made with the needle).  Overall, minimal leakage from the straw even when cup is dropped from the table to the floor.  Holds up to countless dishwashing cycles too.  Semi-resistant to straw chewing due to the hard straw material, although they can be flattened with persistent chewing...",B00B071M0E,Baby_Products
1967,5.0,Finally! Perfect fit and does not wobble!!,My son is almost two and a half and we started potty training a couple of months ago with a little stand alone potty. It worked fine but I was tired of cleaning it. We tried two other training seats that sit on top of our toilet from other brands and they were awful because they did not fit correctly and wobbled every time my son sat on them. He was then scared to use the big toilet.<br />We decided to give this product a try and it is great! It fits firmly onto our toilet and does not budge at all. My son even had to scoot forward a bit to get off of it because his stool is a little low and even while scooting it does not move at all. He even now asks to go pee on the big potty. This product is going to make my life easier and improve my son's confidence with using the toilet. Highly recommended.,B084NGPKHB,Baby_Products
1968,5.0,They‚Äôre good,Absorbs enough for you to end up with a small puddle rather than a massive puddle (assuming you are using them with no pants over for potty training purposes). They fit well and are soft. I thought they washed up well too. I purchased more.,B06XHQK2MF,Baby_Products

1971,5.0,"Using this wipe religiously, worth it if you want the best for your baby",Tried so many different kinds of wipes and was frustrated because all of them caused my baby to break out in rashes. We found out about this from Gimme the Good Stuff and we are so happy to have tried it out! We will never go back now. It is more expensive than the mainstream ones out there like Huggies and Pampers but my baby's skin says it all -- worth every penny!,B01J4CD4UC,Baby_Products
1972,5.0,Ya Ya Scores big with Grandchild,"My granddaughter is 5 and loves the Affix.  I love  how it has the latches to secure it to the seat.  Great colors.  The only thing is the shoulder strap slips down her shoulder if I have it in the middle of the backseat in my little Mazda...next to door fit is perfect, although I like middle seating for safety.  I will try raising the back up a bit and that should fix the middle strap issue.  I ordered two more of the turbobooster without secure latch for other cars and they are just as nice.  I feel much safer with her in this vs the booster without the back/neck attachments.  Thanks Graco",B079Z1YLHH,Baby_Products

However, trying to manage a home business, homeschool our five year old, and maintain our home, it was very challenging to consistently bond through lots of touch and holding. We bought several baby carriers, and none of them helped me, as our baby would not tolerate sitting in them. Out of desperation, I saw the Ergobaby on Amazon, and decided to give it a try. My life forever changed when it arrived. Our son LOVED it! He snuggles right-on down and just coos and/or sleeps. The material is very soft and comfortable for both of us. I can wear it for hours without my back hurting. I cannot say enough good things about this carrier. Yes, it is expensive compared to the other carriers, but it is SO WORTH THE MONEY! I highly recommend this carrier over any of the others.",B00BJCFNKU,Baby_Products

1976,5.0,Best car seat I have ever bought,It is well built with comfortable padding and I love how it reclines. It also extends taller for older kids.  This car seat is well built.  You can use it from 3 month old to almost 6 years old.  It is definitely worth every penny.  I highly recommend this.  It is very easy to adjust the straps. And the cup holders are a good size.,B09GMYTL3F,Baby_Products
1977,5.0,The best ring sling ever,The best ring sling ever! I had a moby sling for my son and he loves it but this one takes the cake.

1978,5.0,1000%,Expensive but so worth the money. I have now purchased 2 of these. I had my first one 5 years ago.. sold it after my son grew out and 5 years later had my daughter and absolutely was not getting anything other than another Doona. Once you have one you will never want another car seat. Super convenient and durable.<br />Only down side is it does not grow with the baby... However not having to drag around another stroller or carry a regular car seat everywhere you go is definitely worth it<br />Would recommend to anyone,B0854829WC,Baby_Products

We are using it to hold all the dog treats but the pockets are big enough you can use it for many different things. The over the door hooks take up very little room but if your door is super snug you may have trouble closing the door. Ours worked fine.,B0BGNJVY4Q,Baby_Products

It's small enough for his little hands to hold on to unlike other teethers we have tried. I also have the Nubby teether keys and they are awkward for him to try to put in his mouth and they are heavy for him. I love that this one has the little bristles on each side but the are alternating sides. The squishy part (blue) is very nice and soft and the harder plastic part (red) is perfect for when he just wants to really chomp down on something! He can easily put it in his mouth and pull it back out again so he has the control. I want an extra for the diaper bag! :D",B0884NBLCM,Baby_Products

It‚Äôs so nice to have the sling right away when they‚Äôre a tiny newborn. And then they move into laying in the tub with the ‚Äúbooster‚Äù in the tub still. Next step they can move into sitting in the green supportive seat. And last, if you want to, you can take the greet seat part out and let them sit on their own in the baby tub! The sling can easily be thrown right in the wash and the tub is so easy to wipe down. It‚Äôs just a really nice, well designed baby tub.",B00MASD26Y,Baby_Products

At the same time, we don't want an ugly Diaper Bag either. Thankfully, we found KiddyCare Diaper Bag. This Diaper Bag is just a backpack but it has all the compartments that we were looking for in a diaper bag. We can have the wipes, dryers, and milk all on the same place but in a well distributed, individual compartments. It looks very nice and it's easy to carry on the back while I can still have both of my hands-frees and I can move freely knowing that the backpack is not going anywhere.",B077HNG31D,Baby_Products

Worked well on my kids.<br /><br />I got a little concerned after reading some reviews about its color being too dark so I emailed Babo botanicals customer service with this photo showing the color. They verified it's the correct color and informed that it's due to their new formula with some ingredients removed and some new ingredients added to make it better. So I'm happy with this purchase.",B079NZ6JVK,Baby_Products

2046,1.0,Huge disapointment.,"I am a long time Almond Roca lover. Today I was at CVS and they didn't have any cans of Almond Roca, but they had these Roca Thins; so I bought a bag. After dinner this evening I sat down to watch football and enjoy my treat. What a disapointment. This is nothing like the real thing! It is just flat pieces of chocolate with VERY LITTLE of the toffee, just a tiny bit, just enough to say it was there, but not enough to taste the flavor of the toffee or even have a crunch. There is so little toffee that I put it back in the bag and I will take it to work tomorrow. Someone will eat it. Very sad that the manufacturer has degraded their reputation with this product. I bet they take the toffee scraps from the real Almond Roca and put it in this produce. I bet they thought it was a brilliant way to make money from scrap.I hate to admit it,but now I am going to buy a can of the real thing from Amazon.

I've never experienced any food with such large, hard chunks of pepper. Really, this should not be allowed without a warning to watch out for the pits!

My soul aches with each bite, yet they so deceivingly look and smell like brownies that it just hurts my heart to think of wasting them. If the devil had a cooking show, he would make these. Im not an expert on how ‚Äúketo‚Äù food is supposed to taste but I feel terribly bad for those who wish to try this diet. I wouldn‚Äôt wish it on anyone but my ex. My intestines weep with each swallow, and the aftertaste makes me feel like I coughed up a lung. If you were to open up a AA battery and smear it against the side of an old bus and taste it, that‚Äôs pretty much what these taste like.

He fills the pot with water, drops a large stone in it, and starts cooking in the square.<br /><br />One of the villagers asks what he's doing, to which he replies that he is making ""stone soup"", which tastes wonderful, although it still needs a little ""something something"" to improve the taste. The villager (although rather stingy) doesn't mind parting with a few vegetables, so these get added to the soup. Another villager walks by, inquiring about the pot, and the beggar gives him the ""stone soup"" spiel once again. The villager gives him a little bit of celery to help out.<br /><br />As word gets around (like it does in small villages) more and more people walk by, each adding another ingredient.

I purchased these 1) for the price comparison to the normal Nespresso pods and 2) to try out different flavors not offered by Nespresso. Just for a point of reference, I have a brand new ( &#60;2 Months) Latissima+. After putting in the first pod and running it for a simple espresso was was puzzled to only se a few drops followed by a weak stream come out and finish with no crema (and ~ &#60;1 oz of liquid). I figured it was a fluke, so i tried another; same result. So i tried one of my Nespresso brand pods and, there it was, a perfect pour with crema(~2-2.5 oz).<br /><br />I figured the rate (and amount) of flow wasn't that big of a deal in the grand scheme of things so proceeded to drink it anyways. It had an unbalanced a bitter flavor, almost akin to my first cup after descaling an espresso machine.<br /><br />I am so disappointed with this product since I know, after being in France for some time, that GOOD, generic Nespresso pods are completely feasible.

2210,3.0,not as spicy and more salty than the original (made in Korea),"I grew up eating the original Korean verision of this (made in Korea) but in the States, it's easier to find this noodle made in USA.<br /><br />The smell and the taste are quite similar to the original but it's definitely less spicy and maybe a little more salty.<br />I might find it more salty because the level of spicyness is lower (the more spicy it is, the less salty it probably tastes)<br /><br />One of the pros of this USA version would be the microwavable bowl it comes in. I always didn't like the cheap styrofoam bowl for the Korean one and I always removed the noodles from it and let it cook in a separate bowl I have at home. With this USA version, I don't worry about the hot water melting the bowl itself.<br /><br />I guess the taste has been altered to suit the taste of ppl here.

This means that, not only do I not have enough tahini for the original, planned use, but I've now essentially paid TWICE as much for that one jar. I had to throw the other out, as I had no idea whether it had gone rancid, etc. After all, the ""safety seal"" and lid are supposed to be there for a reason. Bummed there appears to be no recourse for this seller/manufacturer caused problem. If it was sold locally, I'd much rather buy it that way.

The box is smaller than I'd expected, especially since it houses 120 tea bags, but the footprint is smaller, and that's a good thing for a small home.  Each stack is 10 teabags. The tea chest is a very dark, non-wood appearing not too heavy box with solid feet and cheap looking shiny brass colored metal hardware.  The interior contains red felt separators which can be removed if you want to use this for larger tea bags or something else after the tea is consumed.  Since it appears that this was marketed as a presentation box for Bentley teas, I'd give it a solid 3 star at the half price cost, would have given it a 4 if it did not have the bright gold Bentley ad on the inside of the lid.  If you actually use the chest to present the teas to guests, it's rather tacky in appearance.  The teas are far from the best I've drunk, but I have found that they are very nice for brewing iced tea.  The bags are made of bleached white paper, sealed at the edges, have a white string and small paper hang tag attached at one pressed seam.  Each bag is enveloped by a brightly colored lightweight paper.  There is not much tea powder residual found inside the paper, so the tea is contained well.

2279,3.0,Weak Flavor,"I seriously love so many of the Tiesta tea flavors.  I have tried Fireberry, Blueberry Wildchild, Watermelon Moringa, Fruity Pebbles and Chocolate Ginger Turmeric.  However this particular flavor fell sort of flat for me.  With the name of Kiwi Cherry Bonanza I expected a more tart, fruity profile rather than a Ginger-centric tea.  It is not that I don't like ginger either, the Chocolate Ginger Turmeric is wonderful, but ginger is in the name so it was an expected flavor.<br />So, for others thinking about purchasing this flavor, please know that this is a ginger first, mild, mild fruit underneath.  It is a very passive tea unlike the others I mentioned above which have a strong, more defined flavor profile.",B01A7G6RTO,Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food

2292,3.0,Gentle but underwheliming cleanse,"This tea is pretty underwhelming...maybe because I'm used to taking three ballerina tea.<br />So heres the ""tea"" on this tea:<br />Firstbtime taking it I took it in the morning since I'd be home all day. I brewed it with 2 tea bags and 2 cups of water hoping for it to be pretty strong. Drank it down and waited...nothing happened. Two days later I decide to try again. I took another reviewers advice and brewed 4 bags in 2cups of water and let it steep over night. In the morning after my run I came home and dranknthe tea down then had some fruit, a banana and watermelon and strawberries. About 1.5 hours later I did have a massive bowel movement. A few cramps but nothing major complain about. I was expecting several toilet trips but I guess that one is all I'm getting. I did have a bit of nausea after the toilet trip but ate some more fruit. So I'll do it again tomorrow and for a few days and report back.<br />I really wish I could just use 1-2 teabags because 4-5 seems over doing it. Needless to say i wont be purchasing this brand anymore.<br />So in conclusion if you're looking for a gentle cleanse with few cramps this is the product for you!

2306,4.0,Bug Off,"I purchased this product because I was going to be traveling in the northeastern part of the U.S. and was concerned with the reports of bed bugs in hotels in this area.  I sprayed the outside of my bags, the luggage rack in the room and all areas around the bed, including the mattress.  Other than a lingering alcohol odor there didn't seem to be any other side effects.  I slept in the bed and had no problems.  I sprayed my luggage on the outside when I returned home. Again no problems.  Were there bed bugs?  I don't know.  I didn't see any.  But I was being cautious in light of the numerous reports.<br /><br />The only problem I have with this product was that I had to repackage it into a small spray bottle to meet TSA requirements of less than 3 0z. liquid for carry-on purposes.  Not a big problem as small empty spray bottles are readily available at the local super market. One 3 oz. bottle is good for a 7 to 14 day trip unless you run into a real infestation; in which case, I would suggest that you change hotels and seek compensation from the original hotel.

Usually when you get a cereal that says there are nuts in it you have to search for them, but in this cereal they are in every spoonful, and they are no small dinky nuts either, they are a nice size to satisfy that nut flavor.  There are so many different textures going on and flavors as well from crunchy corn, cinnamon, buttery tasting pecans, so delicious.

2338,4.0,Excellent flavor,"Excellent flavor! If you are looking for a very ""green"", earthy taste, this is a wonderful option. I have been seeking a Yerba with a flavor profile akin to this for a while now. The actual quality of the herb if wonderful, very clean leaves with a good ratio of twigs.<br /><br />There are a few things to consider, however.<br /><br />Firstly, this is a ""luxury"" yerba. For ~12 USD you can get TWICE the amount of Targui of Cruz de Malta, and for a few more dollars, Playadito. I personally think the price on this should be just a smidgen cheaper for what you get. However, I wouldn't consider it a deal-breaker.<br /><br />On the topic of bang for your buck, this mate has a very short cycle. I notice a steep drop-off in potency and flavor after 2 cycles. Again, not the worst thing, but keep that in mind if you are an all-day drinker. Furthermore, this Yerba seems to have increasing difficulty in keeping its shape with every cycle. By the third cycle you will be constantly re-shaping your herb in the gourd. You can see this in the pictures I've provided. I am on cycle ~5-6 and the leaves have almost completely lost their stickiness.<br /><br />Overall I would definitely recommend this. It has a few too many issues to be my go-to Yerba, but it is a wonderful break up from the (my) day-to-day mundanity of Cruz de Malta and Taragui. Just make sure you are using a ""flat"" style bombilla, you WILL find yourself reshaping your mate often.",B07KGH9P5H,Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food

I was surprised by the spiciness of the black pepper garlic and chili lime flavors! They were more intense than I expected. I wasn't sure how the savory flavors would pair with the sweetness of the coconut, but I would say they complement each other pretty well. Overall, I enjoyed these snacks. The packaging is pretty cute and colorful which I liked as well. It's nice that the bags are resealable.

2350,4.0,We didn't like them as much as normal soft pretzels but thats ...,Had a little bit of an off taste to them. They came thawed not frozen and we froze them so that might have altered the taste. Maybe it was just the type being Bavarian I'm not sure. We didn't like them as much as normal soft pretzels but thats not to say there was anything wrong with them. Giving 4 stars because I think it was more our tatse than the product itself that made us not like them and they don't deserve to be discredited for that.,B01LQTGF8Y,Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food

2356,4.0,I will take my Brittle with a side of Peanut,"I must first preface this review with the fact that I am a texture eater above flavor, and when it comes to sweets a specific texture appeals to my palate.  While this brand appeals to my subjective desires for a hard, candy like, texture, it may not appeal to the broader audience for peanut brittle.  If you are expecting a buttery, melt in your mouth, experience with each bite, this may not be the ""brittle for you"".  However, if you are the type to enjoy your peanut brittle as a hard candy like texture that becomes chewy - warning, may stick to your teeth - this is your product.<br /><br />When it comes to peanut brittle, the star of the show is peanuts.  Yet, in this case, that seems to be the supporting role.  As the size of the can clearly suggests, the brittle is broken down into pieces.  As I dived into the glory that is peanut brittle, I noticed that some pieces are rich with peanut while other pieces were completely devoid of peanuts, and of course there were pieces that fall in the ""in between"".  Overall, by ratio of the foregoing I feel the title describes the product in a few words - at least in my experience.<br /><br />Of course not all people are texture eaters, and in that case taste is the focus and the product tastes pretty good whether you eat a piece with peanuts, or not.  However, this product is more of a hard candy bar than peanut brittle.  Brittle suggests it breaks easily in the mouth but this one takes a bit of force, which is why I feel it compares to hard candy.  Yet, if a hard candy taste of peanut, sugar and syrup with a hint of butterscotch (at least how my palate interprets the taste) is how you like your ""peanut brittle"", you will not be disappointed.<br /><br />The final attribute for all well produced peanut brittle products is how much of the product is in bits (like bars) versus pieces (as in shattered).  Unfortunately, it is hard to say.  The first time I had purchased the product, there were more bits than pieces.  The second time it was the opposite.  Obviously, this outcome is partially reliant upon how gently the product is handled during delivery.<br /><br />In conclusion, it depends upon where you fall as a lover of peanut brittle.  Are you in it for the brittle, or for the peanuts?  If you are in for the brittle, and like your brittle in a hard candy texture, this may be your product. If your idea of the perfect peanut brittle is laden with ""peanuts"", and or expect each bite to melt in your mouth with little effort when it comes to chewing, you should seek your peanut brittle elsewhere.",B007ZZAGP2,Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food
2357,4.0,Best bottled tea I've had,"This is the best bottled tea I've found. It's just what it says -- sweet without being too sweet. All the other bottled teas I've tried have had 2 to 3 times as much sugar in them. I also think honey complements the taste of green tea better than just sugar or HFCS. The tea isn't as strong as what I brew myself, but it's by far the best bottled tea I've been able to find in stores!

2364,4.0,Good! Flavor a bit bland,"My Iberia Yellow Rice came promptly, had a good seal, no ingredients that weren't supposed to be there, and is a good product. The reviews I read show how lots of people do not read what they are looking at. The ingredient list clearly described dehydrated peppers and includes the chicken ingredients. The things people mistook for critters are the dehydrated peppers, not anything else, and are a good addition to the rice. :) This rice cooks up well, just like the directions, and was a good addition to our meal this evening.  Tthe slight acrid edge on the flavor is the turmeric, so not a problem, as this will also be a starting base for Spanish Rice iwith beef, chili powder etc. and tomato sauce perhaps. I love the color, and the addition of peas to the meal really made it cheery and colorful for this time.  Having something all new to us was pleasant, and all in all I would buy this again. :) The one star less is only for the addition of the food coloring to the product. The turmeric would be enough!! :)  Thank you for packing this rice in a jar as well. Bags can be broken so easily.",B09B8J37N1,Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food

I've tried at least a dozen different kinds of all-purpose GF flour mixes. In all fairness, I only used this once to make blueberry muffins and was extremely pleased with the results. Tasted just like regular gluten-filled muffins. I have not tried it to make a cake, cinnamon buns or other baked goods so I cannot vouch for its effectiveness - however based on other reviews, I might avoid that route.

This straight up taste like pulverized dried green peas with a hint of peanut and I didn't get a hint of vanilla or anything else. The texture is also grittier than I prefer, specifically when mixing with water alone (10/10 would NOT recommend doing this, based solely on the flavor and texture).<br /><br />On a positive note, I mixed it with a smoothie and it was surprisingly good (works VERY good with berries and bananas, somehow giving off chocolate notes). My kids loved it too which DEFINITELY makes me happy. Additionally, this powder consistently gives me a healthy buzz of energy that doesn't cause a crash which is really nice.<br /><br />I would absolutely recommend this powder, just wanted to describe my experiences in hopes that it'll help one of you make your decision.",B08B73LZFC,Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food

Costco charges $12 per box.<br /><br />This tea has a much stronger flavor that cheap green tea like Lipton. I really like it, but I guess flavor is a personal thing (else no one would buy limp Lipton).<br /><br />Flavor doesn't compare to what you get at a good Japanese restaurant or tea house, but you can only expect so much from 12 cent tea bags.<br /><br />""Matcha blend"" means you get a small amount of matcha powder in each tea bag. Make sure you pour that into your cup.

I drive with Uber/Lyft and I love to put these out for clients to have on hand before they reach their destination.

And I'm happy with these tasty nuggets. I find in my fairly powerful microwave that i have to run a small plate of the condensed pieces (as they're shipped) for at least 1:45 (package says try 90 seconds to start) and I don't think it's my imagination that after these are taken out of the nuke chamber, they start to contract a bit.<br />But, when you consider that you can get a fresh, hot plate of puffy rinds in very short order, these are well worth the price. Of course you can get a trash-bag full of rinds at warehouse stores and other venues for a couple few bucks but for fresh eating at home, the only thing I'd compare these to is fryin' up a batch and these are hugely more convenient.<br />On a 10 point scale, I'd give these a 7 but on the Zon's 5 star system, I have to go with 4.",B002O5QWD8,Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food

2410,5.0,Long-Time User,"I must admit that I cancelled this order for my Equal Spoonful sweetener because I ordered it too late to arrive when I needed it to.  My fault completely.  However, as a long-time user of the product, I wanted to write my opionion on it.<br /><br />When I first began using Equal (known as Nutrasweet back then), I needed to lose 30 pounds and I was getting 1500 calories a day just from my coffee (creamer and sugar were very calorie dense).  Without changing my diet except for using Equal in my coffee, I lost that 30 pounds and another 10 in about 8 months.  And, no, I didn't add exercise because I was already active.<br /><br />The flavor was not unlike sugar and I can bake with it if I choose ... just not anything like fruit pies that rely on real sugar to help create the juice.  I keep in in my sugar bowl and guests cannot tell the difference.<br /><br />I tried newer sweeteners as they came out, but when Splenda almost gave me kidney failure within a week of using it, I went back to my Equal and will never change.<br /><br />Don't believe all the stories you may hear about Equal turning to fomaldehyde in one's stomach or anything else.  They are NOT true!!!  One would have to use hundreds of large containers of Equal at one time to create any type of health risk, and the risk does not increase at all with continued use.  Do not believe the hype and don't believe the claims by the sweeteners that claim to be natural.

One for me, one for my 13 year old step-son, and one for my husband.  They arrived on April 16th, 2013, impressively packaged (I live in Alaska!) with damp soil and in very good shape. My husband didn't water his enough in the beginning (he thought I was watering it!) and his died within the first month.  The other two are thriving.  I pruned mine into an interesting shape right away, while my step-son waited and just let his do its own thing.  His (pictured in the customer provided photos section with our grey cat Osiris) has had a lot of new growth in the 4 months that we've owned it.  It was kind of round with a curved trunk to start, and with the new growth it looks more like a bonsai with the needles stretching out on both sides. Mine doesn't look as nice, but it still looks great.  I'm hoping to wire it soon, so that the branches on one side start to grow in the opposite direction.<br /><br />My advice would be to leave it alone for the first few months before starting to prune/wire it up.  As for watering, we thoroughly water them as soon as the soil seems to be completely dried out.  We didn't want to over water them.  We keep them on a sunny window ledge.  Obviously when there are many sunny days in a row, we end up watering them more often then when it's damp and cool out.  You just have to check on them every couple of days when it's sunny, and once a week or so when it's not sunny.  That's about it.  We haven't fertilized them or anything yet, though I may start giving them a little Miracle Grow once a month or so.  I know there's special bonsai fertilizer but hopefully I can make due with Miracle Grow or equivalent.  Anyway, bottom line I would highly recommend getting a bonsai from this company.  We have had countless pleasure from taking care of and admiring our little trees!",B000XY08PK,Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food

2443,5.0,Iconic Caffe Latte,"I am having some major surgery coming up.  My doctor recommended a different drink (3 a day for 5 days before surgery - and 3 a day for 2 weeks after). Only problem is the protein drink he recommended was HORRIBLE.  The 5th ingredient is anchovy paste!!  It was truly awful and a hundred bucks for 12 drinks!  So, I asked if I could sub out the awful, super expensive drink for these Iconic drinks.  He agreed!  I ordered the Iconic chocolate truffle, the caffe latte and the vanilla.  Do you like chocolate milk?! Who doesn't, the chocolate truffle tastes like the best chocolate milk you've ever tried!  When I drink the caffe latte I pour it over ice or blend with ice and it's like a really terrific iced coffee!  The vanilla bean is as delicious as it sounds. And they all SMELL good too. Honestly.  All of this, without anything that is bad for you and 20 grams of protein!!  In fact my doctor says he will now recommend these drinks.  When you HAVE to do a meal replacement drink - you have GOT to try these first!  I am soooo grateful for them - for taste and cost!  Plus they are shelf stable!!!  So refrigerate as you need them!  I would give these 10 stars if I could.  Just ordered  more. I never hesitate to update my reviews should new info seem useful.

I would also like to see a little more countries added. Finally the last thing I think would be fun is a more substantial type a box that had maybe more like what foods are best to represent that country like a certain pasta, potato maybe some recipes or maybe a box that covers sweets, sours, salty, crunchy or just plain weird üòâ.

Great alternative to leading competitors - Unbeatable Price,"For the price you cant go wrong, taste very much like leading competitors for which if i had to compare i would say it comes close to Nos and if unfamiliar with Nos then the next closet is the Citrus flavored Monster.<br />In terms of how this compares to others in terms of Caffeine well its on par with the likes of Rockstar or leading brands with 160 mg per can (80 per 8 fluid ounces)<br /><br />One thing i do appreciate about this beverage is the lack of the ingredients where one is known to &#34;crash&#34; from which includes long term withdrawal (yes thats a thing)<br /><br />I was a long time red Bull and Nos Daily drinker and let me tell you that i felt like total crap on the days i went without, i now use those brands sparingly and lean more towards beverages like these for the bulk of the &#34;need a lift&#34; consumption.<br /><br />Final thoughts: While i do admit i find i am lean towards a couple other brands in terms of taste, Although Full Throttle do taste good mind you, i find the compromise is well worth it because of the short / long term value as an energy drink habit can get expensive. In other words those other drinks arent tastier enough to warrant paying double or tripple the cost.<br /><br />Worth noting this is a Coca Cola Product.",B01LXRI3C7,Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food

Do not buy this!<br /><br />First off, let me say that I buy a lot of diamond paintings, so I know how they are SUPPOSED to be. I bought the colorful rose...the picture was beautiful online, I was excited for it. The first thing I noticed was that the symbols/numbers on the sticky sheet were horrible. Some unreadable, some too dark and required a light pointed on the image the whole time. The next thing I noticed was that they only sent 10 baggies of beads...there are supposed to be I think 18. Then, I noticed that the ones They DID send didnt match up! Not the right colors, not enough of most of them even if they were the right colors. One of them, there should have been a large baggie of blue beads, instead they sent a tiny one of pink beads, only like 20 in it.<br /><br />Luckily I have extra beads from other projects, I'm hoping I can salvage it. But I definitely dont appreciate the fact that it seems like they sent an entirely different set of beads than it should have came with.<br /><br />EDITED TO ADD: I added a picture of the finished project.

Here I attach their impressive design on a Concorde (obviously made by the same supplier before rebranded. I'd like to give my utmost praise to the whole team for their superb knowlegde of middle school physics (balance) and very logical stand design (engineering). I'll give $100 to anyone who can make it balance as is. It is beyond my wildest imagination that the the quality control of the factory let it go for sale. Maybe the expensive die-cast molding was already made and nothing they could do. I could post L1049G photos,but I think their Concorde photo would give you a better example. Concorde's under side only has 2 rectangular intakes. No ordnance like military models. Yet, I still feel cheated for not being able to use the stand. Not any retailer's mistake, though.

Since the place I bought it from was useless, I contacted Juki and asked about the non working auto threader and bobbin winder. They emailed me a copy from the manual on how to use it. Duh...THEY DON‚ÄôT WORK!!! I took the machine to a local repairman. He smirked and shook his head when he saw it was a Juki.

You _can_ use the UV light by holding the glass so it illuminates something while looking _around_ the glass at the illuminated area (which is pretty small, about 2 inches wide at best), but that pretty much defeats the purpose of the magnifying glass aspect of the product, and you'd be better off just using a UV flashlight instead.",B071ZSMJM5,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing

The downside is that the quality of ink and pen durability are low, compared to F-C.

Maybe something was lost in translation.

Ten bucks for a four ounce bottle instead of five bucks for the 3/4 oz bottles of Dritz Fray Check seemed like a no brainer. Unfortunately, though it may really stop frays, when they say &#34;Crystal Clear&#34; they mean glossy/shiny, just like a top coat of nail polish.

2681,2.0,POOR INSTRUCTIONS,"My initial impression of this item is very poor.  The instructions are not that helpful.  The instructions are in a small paper & small print.  Originally I was all set to return it, but there aren't any other better options out there for ISS toy that are priced reasonably. I took a photo of the instructions then printed the photo so that I would get a larger set (zoomed/enlarged), something that I can actually see.  I used a utility knife to ensure the parts came off the mold correctly.  I also used supper glue on some parts as they were not able to stay in place.  The instructions were very poor, it took several tries to understand the layout.  I am not impressed.  I looked at the manufacture website to see if they would have better instructions or even a support line, but just as the poor instructions, the website wasn't any better in providing assistance.  I would give a 3 out of 10.<br />Once the item was put together, my son was very happy with it and has enjoyed it a lot.",B00ABY8XQ8,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing
2682,2.0,Never even made the first hole.,"Probably chipboard is too much. And like everyone else I have been reading the same thing happens to me. The top cutting jaw doesn't meet with the bottom square all the way around because for some reason it is machined as a relief lower on the sides, precisely where it doesn't cut. How about that? I have a somewhat fix by cutting the board lengthwise so I can come back at it from the opposite side, and shimmy left and right until it goes thru. But It's not neat sometimes, and I waste material. Ah well. The smaller ones have served me well, and like some say, I do like the way they fold down flat. But this particular size has some blueprint engineering problems and the darn locking mechanism broke after one use..",B0B316BXP1,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing

But the warning on the package says if it gets on your skin wash immediately (see picture) I'm not going to put it on my skin if there is any question about safety so it's money wasted.

I'll likely be buying another set from a different company.",B01HSH2X2K,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing
2685,2.0,Product listing name deceptive,"I was rather disappointed with the size of the product. Most other sellers, when putting a size in the product name line, intend buyers to understand that the size listed is the size of the opening or eyelets for products like this. Not that the total length of the product is 1-1/4‚Äù. I need to order another batch of snap hooks now to finish these projects. The only reason I‚Äôm not returning them is it would cost more to return them than it cost to buy them. I gave more than one star is because they all seem to be functioning and at least look halfway decent.",B081CF4FXF,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing
2686,2.0,Hooks Are Very Heavy,"I ordered these ""aluminum"" hooks because I needed the very large sizes for crocheting blankets, but I didn't expect them to be so heavy!  I have osteoarthritis and just holding the 12mm and 15mm hooks was impossible without pain, let alone crocheting with them.  I can't believe they are aluminum, they are heavy like steel. It may be false advertising. I gave them a two star only because they are made well.  If you have arthritis or problems with lifting heavy objects with your hands consider another option in hooks.  Sooo disappointed.",B091G8PSQJ,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing

The colors are vibrant, though.",B0C7CXW1JB,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing
2698,2.0,Don't use with a multi-needle tool,"I bought this foam mat from a craft store, not from Amazon and I have to admit I am rather disappointed. This foam is very much like the one you find in computer packaging. It has little air bubbles in it, and once you pierce the air bubbles, the foam collapses - it does not spring back. So if you plan to felt a LOT, this is not for you. It works ok for single needle work, but for flat objects, say a flower petal, that require a multi-needle tool, the fibers tend to get stuck in the foam, making the felt look hairy and permanent indentations form in the foam where all the air bubbles have popped. Afterwards, the needles have a harder time penetrating the indented areas. So once you've felted something on every single square inch of the foam piece, you pretty much have to buy a new one. I also think the price is a bit steep for a piece of foam that doesn't last.",B0016848IK,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing

2705,3.0,Too hard to measure on black,"I recently purchased this mat in black - BIG MISTAKE!  It is so difficult to see to cut small quilt pieces.  The lines are every 1/2"" instead of every 1"" and I don't like that, either.  It's one of those things that you can't know you hate it until you try it.

2714,3.0,They were easy to use,"The pros of these pencils are the following. They were easy to use, they laid color down easily without having to apply a lot of pressure. They blended well with other colors without a lot of wax build up.<br />They are wonderful pencils for children and adults who just want to color. The price is affordable and the quality was good. They sharpened easily without breakage.<br />From an artist perspective, I did not like the following things. The pencils are not numbered nor are the colors named on the pencils, making them difficult to identify when drawing a piece. There were only 48 pencils and because of the small selection, most of the colors tended to be on the dark side. Because the pencils were in a cardboard box, I bought a carrier to place them in to make them more accessible and portable.<br />If you are just looking for an affordable good quality pencil  for recreational coloring, you might want to give these pencils a try.",B01JDY1VY2,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing

What arrived was three gray pairs. One of the reasons I wanted the three colors is because it is easier to tell where the scissors need to be returned. I wanted one pair for three different places.

2719,3.0,NOT USEFUL FOR NARROW OPENINGS LIKE IN FACE MASKS!!,"I bought this to help me insert elastic into facemasks. I was very happy with the flexibility and how it clipped in the elastic to hold it. But THEN, when I tried inserting it, I found that the part holding the elastic was HUGE compared to the body of the thing and would NOT go through a half-inch channel! I tried to push it through and ended up getting it stuck in my mask. Fortunately, I was able to get it out without destroying my mask, but it was close! If it were designed so that the holder part was as small as the rest of it, it would be good. This is a HUGE design flaw! I kept it because it will probably be useful if I make something where I have a minimum of an inch wide channel that needs elastic and such. If you are tying to find something to use for face masks, this is NOT it.",B08B8HVCCS,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing

The stoppers also rub off on your paper, if it's longer than the shelves, by leave black streaks. They are kind of erasable so you can save the paper. I knew my pages would be slightly longer; I usually work in 15'' x 22'' watercolor sheets as my largest size... so I doctored the stoppers by wrapping around them with duct tape. It seems to hold my pages better in place, too.<br /><br />Like I said, it's not perfect, but if you're on a budget and you need to be conscientious of space, this will work until you can get a more ideal, expensive drying system.<br /><br />ALSO, it is worth mentioning that some of the shelves were completely unusable.

Haven't used the hat/plate presses. It's annoying that the timer won't start unless the heat is at the exact temp, so you have to start it before you begin pressing, but not a deal-breaker. I don't understand the min/max temp thing so I just set them both the same. No holes so you can attach it to a tabletop.<br /><br />Overall- works as a budget friendly option for a newbie.

Cheap price.<br /><br />Cons - Cheaply made (you get what you pay for), half of the caps fit tightly the others are loose.  I understand that sometimes the cap and ink do not match, but at least should be close.  There are several in this package that are totally wrong.  For instance a cap and end cap show a pretty bright red, the ink is actually a dark burgundy, cap and end cap show pink, inside is dark purple/pinkish.  I have included a picture of some of the worst examples.  The nib of one pen where the metal piece screws onto the body was broken (like it was screwed on too tight and the plastic body broke.) There was no broken piece inside, so can't be glued back together.  Another thing that should be said, some flow and feel really good when writing.  Others feel draggy, so you have to write slower to get good coverage.  Several of the pens would not work at all (none had the wax on the tip) but was remedied by tapping the tip on a stack of paper, some had to be tapped several times before the ink started flowing.<br /><br />My recommendation: if you plan to use these for just coloring, which is what I bought them for, they should be okay, but I would wait till it goes on sale lol.",B072BTC5PV,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing

2767,3.0,"Cool material to try, a bit difficult to use","This was the first time I ever used paper clay (don't be deceived by the name, it is paper clay). I like that it dries very hard, and you can apply it to other surfaces without it breaking away once dry. For example, I had a plastic castle that had the turrets break off (because I'm a butter fingers and dropped it). I used the paper clay to remodel the turrets and applied directly onto the plastic. I let it dry fully, then spray painted. It's hard as a rock and fully adhered to the plastic (without glue). On the con's, it is a very crumbly material. It's very hard to get a smooth finish like you would with regular clay. When I work with it, it's like a chunky, very dry, and crumbly material. I think you can do some really cool stuff with this, but I hate how dry it is. A fun side of this is it will make your hands feel very velvety while working with it (of course, washing it off afterwards).",B085LKMBN2,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing

2773,3.0,"End result is cute, but not the highest quality materials","I got this for my 5 year old who loves art and painting and all that. It's a cute idea for sure--two pretty simple paint by number canvases with paint, paintbrushes, and hanging hardware. While the activity is fun, nothing is high quality. It's all pretty cheap. The paintbrushes aren't very good, the paint is super thick and kind of hard to paint with. It doesn't spread easily. The paint is also hard to open which inevitable leads to paint getting on fingers when you finally are able to pry it open. Though they are pretty simple drawings, there are some small areas that require intricate painting, and that is hard to do with these materials (and also when you are five. Lol.) For example, the whiskers on the lion's face and the pupils in his eyes are all white and very small areas surrounded by dark colors. It's very hard not to paint in those areas with the dark paint. And because the paint is so thick it sort of stays in globs, you need to paint over it a few time to spread it around and of course, my 5 year old would lose patience. (Perhaps it's better for older kids? I think the design would be too simple for older kids to be honest.)<br /><br />Overall, the end result was cute, but I was kind of thinking I should have just used my one paint and paint brushes for the activity.",B08TGG97PP,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing

I was amazed at how many people have never seen ""A Christmas Story"" and looked at me funny when told what I intended to make.  I turned it into a joke and asked to see shoes for my girlfriend, and when asked what size she needed, I'd say she's with me and pulled the leg out of the box it came packaged in!  It was good for a few laughs.)<br /><br />Anyway, most high-heel ladies shoes are not quite as high as this arch is.  Also the mold seams were a little rough and had to be cleaned up to keep the stocking from tearing when applied.  The leg looks more designed to display ladies hose than to actually fit a shoe.  I did finally find a leather shoe I was able to fit onto the leg, but again I had to look far and wide to find one pair that had the style I was looking for and actually fit the extremely high arch of the foot.  It would be nice if the company offered a shoe that would fit this ridiculously high arch.<br /><br />Also, as one person pointed out, this leg is not translucent and will cast no light from inside of the leg itself.

2820,4.0,Good for those who do not plan on buy an Airbrush in the near future.,"Other than it took about almost a week longer than the estimated shipping date was stated as, for me who just got into Gundam models i would point out that i'm just a newb so..<br />I went and did the coloring for the entire strike freedom 1/100 MG kit and from what some would expect, there were tracks here and there, so i tried to touch it up the best i could and for the most part due to my tenacity I was able to get rid of most of them and make the coloring pretty even.<br /><br />But, I would suggest that these be best used for touch ups on small parts. I also, due to my inexperience with models in general, I did not marker every piece individually, I just took the arms legs and torso and marked them. I learned that doing it this way makes the joints stick and possibly break(was able to fix that with glue) so I learned to gently move parts around.<br /><br />Other than that I think it's worth it. But if you plan on buy an Airbrush, I would suggest you do so and use these for touch ups only. But if you are not, then these are good. But, I leave that to your own discretion.<br /><br />I don't have much money so i can't just go off and buy an airbrush and paint.

2857,4.0,Most backings work great,"I bought this a while ago to replace the small, plastic backings that usually come with pins. I love to put pins on my backpack but the plastic backings do not lock, and I've had pins fall off before (either naturally or by getting pulled on a little bit). Because of that, a friend of mine gifted me some locking backings (around 5-6) and I loved them, so I decided to go on Amazon and buy more.<br /><br />These pins work great, and I appreciate the different colors so that I can match the backings to my pins and know which pin is where by matching the color scheme of my pin to its backings. Additionally, the locking mechanic works really well--I can tell for sure no pin will ever fall off, even if it is pulled on. However, these backings can be pretty hard to get off if you just use your fingers, so I've taken to using the file of my miniature Swiss army knife in order to pull the backing off. You have to lift the little mechanism for it to unlock, but I just don't have the strength, and it'd probably break my nails if I tried to use those. Furthermore, although I haven't used all the backings a few of them have not wanted to lock onto my pins for some reason so I have just dropped them back in the package and used a different one. I don't know if the backing itself is flawed or maybe I just didn't use them at the right angle, but I've had trouble getting maybe 3-4 of them (in both colors) to lock. Still, there's so many that I haven't really viewed this as an issue.<br /><br />Overall, I'd say these are pretty good pin backings, definitely good for pins that might get caught on things because of their location (like a backpack). They are very tall though so they probably wouldn't work well on shirts, and might get caught on notebooks etc if you are not careful. However there are inside pockets in my backpack so I'm not worried about it.",B01N0V40CW,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing

So keep in mind what they have charged for this product in the past before purchasing for more. The wood is unfinished but you can use it as is, paint it or stain and lacquer it like I did. It does come with a pallet but it's not very nice. Odd shape, edges were chipping away. It does have a nice roomy drawer compared to other ones I've seen. It's a decent size for smaller paintings. Definitely more of a beginner product that can still be used as you grow as an artist.",B019BKYPBY,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing

For much wider than that,  use a hook with a cable.  Buy bamboo.  Plastic ones get yucky and the cables pull off. (I have thrown away two complete sets of plastic with cables.) 14"" straight hooks will make a project up to 20' in length, but are too heavy at the end.<br /><br />Toward the end of my afghan, the stopper popped off the 7mm.

2891,4.0,Don't toss that stubby pencil -- get a lengthener!,"My relationship with writing utensils is...well, complicated. I‚Äôll spare you my meditations on that (to me) fascinating topic and cut to the chase: you either like to use old-school pencils, or you don‚Äôt. IF you‚Äôre in the former category, lengtheners probably make sense for you. (If your immediate thought was, OMG! Seriously?, you might want to skip the rest.) As you sharpen pencils, they get shorter, and become increasingly difficult to use. At somewhere around the half-way point, they pretty much become all but useless: too short for folks with large hands. Toss ‚Äòem? That bothers me -- hence my attachment to lengtheners.<br />I‚Äôve used plastic lengtheners before, and while they get the job done, they aren‚Äôt as aesthetically pleasing as wood. Score one for the BQLZR: real wood. Another plus: five in a pack for under six dollars, with free shipping. On the downside, the metal chuck that holds the pencil isn‚Äôt always attached very well to the wooden shaft. Two of mine completely separated -- not a huge problem: a bit of glue fixes that right up. I‚Äôd also prefer a slightly large diameter. Overall, though, I‚Äôm pleased with the purchase, and would certainly buy them again.",B00SF4XX7K,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing

Unfortunately, it seems as though either the glue, the binding, or a both were not sturdy enough to live up to its purpose. I had only been using this planner for about 3-4 weeks when the outside cover detached from the pages. I suppose I can attempt to super glue it, but this is an inconvenience for sure.<br />As a law student, I‚Äôm constantly having to take my planner in and out of my bag, which is why wanted to avoid a flimsy spiraled planner, but perhaps that‚Äôs the way I should have gone.",B07PWLDV38,Office_Products

3013,1.0,just gave up,"i had callvantage for about 10 months and it was always spotty.  set up was a cinch, and the website they provide is excellent.  however, from the moment i plugged the telephone adapter in, i had problems.  i can't recall the model number of the TA, off-hand.  but it was one of their earlier linksys models.  the installation instructions stressed that the TA needed to sit between my cable modem and wireless router.<br /><br />my first issue became apparent immediately after installation.  my phone worked just fine and i made a number of calls.  my wireless router, unfortunately, was totally neutralized.  i could connect to it directly.  dhcp still worked.  i could log in and play with my administrator settings (to no avail).  i just couldn't access the internet.  as best i could tell, the Telephone Adapter was totally and completely blocking traffic that was coming from the wireless router.<br /><br />this problem was eventually resolved by their tech support.  i believe what they did was open up the TA to all traffic coming from my router's IP.  i didn't question the safety of this solution... i was just happy to have my internet working.  it was at this time that i was made aware of an interesting feature of this (and perhaps other) telephone adapters.  the TA tests and maintains a minimum amount of bandwidth with the outside world.  if the TA detects too much non-VOIP traffic passing through it from the internet to devices inside its network (or vice versa), it resets itself and/or blocks the traffic.<br /><br />that bears repeating.  if the TA determines its not getting enough bandwidth, it claims it all for itself...  this has nothing to do with whether or not you're using the phone at the time -- an incoming call could come at any moment.  but when the TA does this, and i never figured out how to adjust that cutoff threshold, you've got no internet.<br /><br />at times, it took 10 or 15 minutes before i could connect to the outside world again.  for someone who works in IT from his home, this is unacceptable.  worse, for those 10 or 15 minutes, all the cost advantages of using this service evaporate.  i'm paying $40/month for broadband internet access that i can't use.  in my mind, callvantage just got $40/month more expensive...  because that's all i can use my cable modem for.<br /><br />other issues abounded, but they all seemed to trace back to the fact that my TA was bunk and seriously hogging my connection.  i had a desktop computer connected directly to the TA and it exhibited every symptom of this problem you could imagine.  slow downloads.  pages not loading.  strange browser errors about not being able to access a domain (blocking traffic to/from my DNS servers?) and web pages that would only load if i typed ""[...]"" before the ""google.com"".<br /><br />i called callvantage customer service at least a dozen times, but not with great regularity.  regardless of what the other reviewers have said about customer service, with the myriad problems i had with callvantage, not once did their customer service line keep me on hold for less than 10 minutes.  these customer service representatives are trained to guide you through exactly two procedures: 1) resetting all of your hardware by powering down, then powering it all back up in order and 2) testing the speed of your internet connection using speakeasy.net's online tool.  most of the problems i had with the service required multiple calls to reach resolution (or reach kludge, depending on your POV).  however, these first line customer service reps ALWAYS insist on you doing these two things first...  carefully and calmly explaining that you called an hour prior and 1) reset everything and 2) tested your speed is useless....  say it to the wall before you call them... that might ease the frustration.<br /><br />there were a couple times where it appeared that resetting everything solved the problem... but the solution was never permanent.  and not once while doing the speedtest did a customer service rep tell me that i did not have a fast enough connection to continue using (and paying for) their services.<br /><br />the final straws for me came when i suggested that perhaps they should send me a new telephone adapter, perhaps a more sophisticated model.  the customer service rep explained, without a hint of irony in her voice, that it was company policy not to replace hardware until the customer had called 5 times about the same problem.  the catch there is that, even if you call up every tuesday and friday to complain about the same problem, if you wait more than 24 hours between calls, they kick you out of the ticketing system and the next time you call it's a ""new problem"".<br /><br />i explained that this was my 6th or 7th time calling in the course of a month about web pages not loading on my computer connected to the TA and she told me that i would be bumped up to the ""next tier"" of technical support.  that pretty much did it...  who the hell had i been talking to all along?  the ""next tier"" conferenced into my call and there was some jabber about whether or not i reset the cable modem and TA properly (hilarious)... then they told me someone would get in touch with soon.  two days later, at around 10pm, i received a call on my cell phone from a technical support person.  i explained that i was miles away from my computer, and that it was friday night.  he asked me to call him back at a certain 800 number which, now, i wish i could share with the world.  unfortunately the piece of paper it was written on was torn to shreds when i called the number that saturday and was told that my ""problem ticket"" had been ""resolved"".  i would have to go back to ""first tier"" customer support, reset my adapter and test my speed a half-dozen times, and then maybe someone technical would be willing to hear my case.<br /><br />that was when i gave up....  problems with loading web pages in my browser were clearly not going to be resolved by these people.  what's more, the phone itself started cutting out in the middle of calls.  i'd pick it up and hear no dial tone.  i'd call someone and get an operator explaining the number was not in service.  simply deplorable.<br /><br />when i called to cancel, the fellow i spoke to asked if he could entice me to stay by offering me a free month's worth of service.  i explained that my service had been near-useless for the last month and pretty damned spotty for the 9 that preceeded that.  i'm rolling it back to a regular land-line.  there isn't enough ""UNLIMITED CALLING!!!"" advertising in the world that's going to make me consider using this again.",B0002OQVWU,Office_Products

3015,1.0,A piece of junk if there ever was one,"the facts about this product, and why it's reviews are split between good/bad- it's deceptive (in other words, the product itself is).  the deception occurs where the product is half quality and half poorly, cheaply-constructed worksmanship.  It's selling point is the quality part, which is the gel/memory foam cover (fairly nice), and the chief auxiliary feature which is the footrest sliding backwards and forwards (something i bought it for, as legs need to move vs. be stuck in one position even if they're raised).  The height is decent (at least for me, being 5'3"")  the verdict for me would be that i wouldn't have bought this given the beyond-poor funcitonality.  the lock on mine doesn't work. period. at all. i lock it, the footrest slides back and forth. i unlock it, the footrest slides back and forth. so, my feet slide forwards and backwards as my weight shifts with every little movement while i work.  if its important to you that this work the way its advertised, then don't buy this.  if its enough for you that your foot has a nice squishy gel pad under it, and you don't care about your legs being tossed in any which position upon your every move, then this should more than suffice. i originally gave it two stars, but i took one off because of the fact that i also don't have the kind of time i need to go through the return process for a product not being what it's advertised as, and that is something amazon should address on the front end, i.e. be able to back products up which they sell.  i'm now sitting here with a $45 non-functioning footrest until i can buy one that works. shame shame amazon!",B0002DR45E,Office_Products

All reception sounded fuzzy, even after two phone calls to AT&T for customer support.  All AT&T could offer was to suggest I move closer to the base (I was standing right next to it), unplug my modem (I did and that didn't help), confirm that I wasn't next to a TV tower (I'm at least three miles away from the closest tower), and come up with any other they could think of to prove the problem was me and not the phone.  Ultimately, I was told by customer support that something was indeed wrong withthe phone, but this is a discontinued model, they don't repair it and I should return it to the vender from whom I purchase it.

Well, needless to say, they didn't. Still got complaints of my voice breaking up on the other end.<br /><br />So I finally left Ooma the other day, and the new VoIP service is doing well so far. It was hard to talk Ooma into letting me go, when I called after porting the phone number to the new guys, my account was still open on the internet. Usually when you port your number away from a service, your account closes automatically. They tried everything that they could think of to get me back, but I was calling to cancel my account. They eventually got it, but only after I repeated that I was calling to cancel my account many times. Since I'm dependent on them to cancel the account and not make any more charges against my credit card, I tried to be patient, but when I made it clear to them that I wasn't going to use any of their other services or visit Ooma on anyone else by selling the Telo,  they finally gave up.<br /><br />Good feeling to have decent phone service again.

IN ADDITION TO THE POOR TECHNOLOGY NOTED BELOW, OOMA IS ALSO ONE OF THOSE COMPANIES THAT ASKS YOU FOR A CREDIT CARD ""JUST IN CASE"" THEN BEGINS A MONTHLY SUBSCRIPTION CHARGE WITHOUT YOUR CONSENT.  STAY AWAY FROM THESE GUYS!!!<br /><br />With the ease and seemlessness of wifi connectivity to every device in your house these days (tv, computer, cell phone, alexa, refrigerator, etc.), you would think that a wifi-connected voip phone would be a slam dunk.  It's not.  I spent over four hours on the phone with Ooma's technical support over the course of three days and never could get the unit to connect to my wifi.  I give the tech support staff credit for sticking with me, trying lots of fixes, calling me back when they told me they would and offering to replace my unit.  In the end, I just don't think this unit is ready for prime time.<br /><br />The cell phone set-up app is very buggy and bombs out or locks up when it gets confused.  Tech support's fallback is to connect directly to the router or to a laptop via an ethernet cable.  In my case, I couldn't go to the router and my laptop doesn't have an ethernet port.  I had to borrow my laptop docking station from work which does have an ethernet port.  Both my laptop and the phone app could see the Ooma device and the wireless network, but just couldn't complete the connection.<br /><br />After many rounds of the standard tech support fixes:  ""turn it on and off again"", ""unplug and reconnect the ethernet cable"", ""delete and reinstall the app"", I finally gave up and returned the device.

Then, I gently (key word, GENTLY‚Äîgiving pop-up cards is something of an obsession for me, so I have handled extremely delicate ones in the past and always use the absolute minimum pressure to open them) begin to open the card to see how it looks, and it INSTANTLY snaps (first pic.) That is extremely frustrating, but I collect myself and try to keep opening it while (g e n t l y) holding the broken side down to see if it will still look okay once I glue the broken part back. Spoiler alert: it will not. The card is way too stiff to open and stand properly. I think the cup part is much stiffer/thicker than the part that anchored it, which is why it broke so easily. Anyone with two brain cells could understand than the part KEEPING THE CARD TOGETHER should be the strongest part of the card.

The little tab at the bottom of the stapler that makes the staple bend inward after you staple popped off completely. I could probably glue it back on, but this is not something I would expect from a stapler that costs 25 dollars.  It is currently being held on by a piece of tape.<br /><br />The 2nd problem I've encountered is in regard to the spring mechanism that pushes the staples forward as you use it. I don't really know what happened there but it just failed. Now to get the staples to continually feed, I have to tilt the stapler downward to get the staples to fall forward (gravity at work here).<br /><br />I really liked the original model and expected the same quality from the generation II model. Maybe I just had bad luck with this particular unit, but overall pretty disappointing product.",B002M8EY82,Office_Products

When the pads arrived they appeared to be made out of a very thin veneer with a bit of high-density cardboard backing that had cracked.  There was only one thumbscrew per seat (two would be better at preventing shifting), and the vinyl was attached clumsily with too many overlapping loose staples.  It's simple upholstery to trim the vinyl and fold it like you are wrapping a holiday gift.  These appear to have been wrapped and stapled in the dark.

3200,3.0,A Case Of Problems,"Disclosure: This was sent to me for free via the Vine program. I did not receive monetary compensation to write this review, just the product itself.<br /><br />I love me some writing utensils, especially fountain pens. I've mentioned it in the past. I also like gel pens as well, with my daily pen being the Pentel EnerGel X .7mm. Rollerball pens I'm give and take on because it really depends on the pen but when this set promised a gel pen AND a German iridium tipped fountain pen, I decided that I needed to do some scribbling. But when it arrived, it was a whole different case altogether...almost literally.<br /><br />The problem itself isn't necessarily with the pens. The pens themselves are serviceable. The rollerball is a twist-to-open and comes with one rollerball in the pen and two spare. It writes fairly smoothly but the ink smudges a bit unless you let it dry quite a bit. The same can be said of the gel pen: it comes with a cartridge in the pen and two spare, both tipped with a small plastic bead to keep the ink from drying out. It, too, has a tendency to smudge if not left to dry but it definitely writes smoother than the rollerball. The fountain pen is probably the best of the bunch. It comes with a converter in it; a piston design with agitator I'd never seen before in my pen travels.  The converter has almost a shielded piston that's operated by pushing a tab on only one side of the converter itself. It also comes with two refills which look to be the short international standard type. It's scratchy at first but after a bit of time writing (or sandpaper, your choice) it writes decently enough with a slightly thin but adequate ink flow.<br /><br />The problem itself lies in the case. The case, as seen in the pictures, has room for three pens. What it COMES with is more than three pens; it comes with 3 pens, two rollerball refills, two gel pen refills, and two fountain pen refills.  When it arrived in the box, these were all just loose and bopping about. It's a miracle and a half none of the fountain pen cartridges burst because I've had them burst on me when packed in a shrink-wrapped box of 10, inside a padded envelope, inside a box with packing paper. These were just chilling in the bottom like a junk drawer when I got them. And when you DO get them...there's nowhere to put it. The case the pens come in is cut and stained wood with hinges with three grooves for the pens on the top and bottom. I tried gently layering them in the little divots but then the thing wouldn't shut. There's no external compartment for them, either...so I just put them in a small bag and rubber-banded it to the top of the case.<br /><br />The pens are adequate, the case is rough but functional, but the accoutrements are just kinda left about willy nilly in the box. Considering it's loose ink, flying at various pressures, and being jockeyed around warehouses and on/off vehicles, it's a significant risk that those fountain pen refills are gonna burst. $18 is a fair price, I guess, for that risk. Just make sure to have some solvent handy.",B09TVYS2JK,Office_Products

They do in fact write more smoothly than other ballpoint pens I own.<br /><br />As far as I can see, this is their only positive. There is nothing special about the design. It's just a plain pen. Worse, they lack a crucial feature that I have been accustomed to seeing in disposable, ballpoint pens for at least 15 years, as a matter of course. That feature is padding in the grip to prevent the formation of a painful callus from writing. These pens are also not retractable, which most inexpensive, ballpoint pens have been for many years now as well.

Paper is starting to roll onto the cutter instead of dropping into the basket, and because of how it's constructed, it's extremely hard to clear the paper from the inner mechanism.

The outer cover was askew and its seams did not line up on the cushion as they should have.  In other words, it seemed that either the outer cover was too small for the cushion, or the cushion was too large for the cover.  Although the cover is soft, it does not appear durable and I would hesitate to remove it and wash it due to the questionable fit.  The cushion fit well on my chair and was comfortable, but I was hoping it would have been firmer and able to maintain its shape.  It flattened within a few minutes.

3244,3.0,Abysmally poor scanning software,"I bought this printer through a special offering from the manufacturer a little less than a year ago.  The print quality is excellent, printing is fast.  So much better than the Canon inkjet I had previously.  However, be warned that the scanner is virtually unusable over the network.  Most of the time connected computers respond with ""No scanners were detected"".  This is despite the fact that an IP address is displayed on the printer, that you can address the printer with a web browser using the displayed IP address, and that you can print.  Uninstalling/reinstalling, updating firmware, etc. does not help.  Even when it one upon a time worked, it was necessary to send a 'scanback' notice from a computer to the printer, then physically go to the printer/scanner, find the scanback notice on the functions screen, select it, then press the start arrow on the touch screen.  After that, the 'scanback' option disappears.  When it works, a lot of walking back and forth between computer and scanner (which in my case is in another room).  My old Canon ""just worked"", push a button and the scan was delivered to the selected computer.<br /><br />I've seen a lot of bad software in my long career, but this has to be the worst.  A real shame since the hardware is excellent.<br /><br />I have found a workaround, inconvenient but better than beating the desk over a ""No scanners were detected"" message.  Devote a USB flash drive to scanned images.  Plug it into the scanner, use the touch screen to select USB, scan to usb.  This works.  Then, carry the USB drive to the computer and copy it from there.<br /><br />Lexmark should be ashamed.",B08VGG1TBY,Office_Products

I know it sounds a little crazy the way i described this but it's actually what it does. This type of stapler is really good if you have papers at home that you want to staple together like your bills. It saves staples and also helps you get organized. My friends were really fascinated with this stapler because of the way it was structured. I personally like it too just its not so great, you must APPLY A LOT OF FORCE sometimes if you want it to work properly, other wise it's not a big deal you would just need to stick the paper into the hole that the stapler created.

Third, the drawer handles come with the screws attached so you have to try to unscrew them from the handle without any leverage. I actually stabbed myself with the screw driver trying to get them out and will now have a huge bruise.

I like the curvy wedge shape, because I can easily put my feet in different positions and at different heights. Having the zipper on the upper edge is a good design choice so that the zipper isn't damaged during use. The cover feels nice on bare feet and stays pretty well on my office floor (low pile carpet).

3311,4.0,Great Solution for Scanning those old 35-mm slides and photos,"I have a ton of old 35mm slides that I wanted to digitize (some dating back to the early 60's).  After a lengthy online review of available scanners, I chose the Epson V850 as it was under a $1,000 and was advertised to do a good job on color retention (due to LED lighting - pure white) and resolution.  I scan my 35mm slides at 3200-bpi and the results are simply terrific.  I also plan to scan some old photos where I don't have the original negatives, although I can also scan the negatives as well for those that I do.  Scanning of 35-mm slides takes about 10-minutes to 15-minutes; you can do 12-slides at a time so it takes some time but the results are very good.  Like any old materials, sometimes there are dots and dirt on the slides; I digitally remove them with my Windows 10 Photo tool which has an excellent spot removal feature (minor touchup).  The V850 came bundled with Epson's own software which is what I use.  I thought I would prefer the Silverfast software which came bundled but that user interface was overwhelmingly complex for operations like dust removal, etc. and found the Epson software was &#34;good enough&#34; for me.",B09NNLBNF6,Office_Products

3349,4.0,DoxieQ is a great ScanSnap replacement!,"Ive been a scansnap user for 8-9 years now. Scansnap has been neglecting their mac drivers for years (they never bothered to sign their drivers to begin with - seriously questionable quality thats only grown worse over time.)<br /><br />My initial experience with Doxie was positive but the change in my workflow was challenging at first mainly due to the indirect scanning model. With scansnap you use the scanner as a device firmly attached to your operating system and scan directly into an application. With doxie you are scanning into a memory card on the doxie then downloading your scans after the fact. Since I OCR all my documents this was an extra step in my flow and frustrating at first.<br /><br />But then i started scanning docs without getting my computer out and downloading/ocring the docs at a later date. This change has been a revelation! Im no longer faced with a huge pile of mail to scan that I put off out of laziness. Now i just snag the doxie, send the docs through it quickly and put it away. Every few weeks Ill turn the wifi on and download the docs to my mac and ocr them. This has turned out to be a far more efficient strategy to get through a task that I constantly procrastinated on.<br /><br />Im leaving with 4 stars due to some small software issues that Ive discussed with doxie and will hopefully be resolved shortly (when Ill update to a 5 star I hope!) Nothing major just a couple of tiny user interface things in their app like showing the progress of the ocr process and streamlining the function buttons on the window chrome.<br /><br />Overall Im extremely pleased with this device as a critical piece of my paperless workflow at home. Ill be giving these out for gifts this holiday season (ssssshhhhh) and expect my family will enjoy using doxie as much as I am!",B08X4P17DX,Office_Products
3350,4.0,Stay Awake After Lunch,"I've been using the Varidesk Pro Plus for nearly a week now. It has some great benefits and features, but loses a star for one specific reason. The thing is sturdy, even fully extended I don't think it will tip. I'm not that tall, and in the position I use it, I have no worries about walking away from it or leaning on it, etc. Although - and this is the reason for docking a star - I tend to type quite strongly, apparently, and my monitor vibrates a bit. Clicking around is fine, but banging out a missive on the email causes a bit of shaking (perhaps a reminder to take a deep breath and stop banging!). Overall, I'm enjoying standing up for most of the day (haven't quite reached all day yet, hence the unit being able to rise and collapse is worth the spend). I would certainly recommend getting an anti-fatigue matt along with it. While standing has been great for my back, my knee is feeling it. I think that will pass with time though. The one thing I am truly enjoying is not having that sleepy moment post lunch. You all know what I'm talking about: half an hour, maybe an hour after lunch and that nap time feeling hits. When I come back from lunch, I always put it up and power through that *yawn - it's time for some more coffee* feeling. That is worth the money alone. This unit has caused quite a sensation at my work, which I was not quite prepared for. We have a well established wellness curriculum, but it didn't include this (which I purchased on my own dime). About half the company has come by to gawk and ponder if it's worth it. My two cents: Yep.",B0C1CQ1XLC,Office_Products
3351,4.0,Too Soft,"To preface this review, I have a Fine Arts Degree and thus used many different styles of erasers for various ways. The product is a decent eraser but not for the application that I need.  I bought this eraser to use with a Rotring mechanical pencil and HB lead so I am not erasing art drawings but rather written words: notes taken during a class. This eraser is too soft. It will not rip your paper or harm/smudge laser or inkjet printed material if erased over.  However, it does not erase the pencil lead thoroughly.  There is still a faint line left.  Also, the eraser shreds easily making it hard to erase with precision.  Ultimately, I had to buy a Staetler Mars Plastic eraser because this one annoyed me too much to continue using for this purpose.",B000KJNY9A,Office_Products

3356,4.0,Get The Headrest!,"You will probably regret not spending the extra little bit of money for the headrest. I did not get it. The chair went together quickly and easily for me. The seat itself is rubber-like coated mesh, and the back is uncoated mesh. The coating on the seat prevents those little adjustments we all do when sitting at a desk for any length of time. It grips your clothing so you're sliding around in, and limited to, any slack you have in the seat of your clothes. The seat is shallow, meaning it's short from front to back. The back is comfortable, with excellent lumbar support. The flip up arms are great!  The fact that it reclines is amazing! However, the lever to lock the seat in place is quite a reach when locking and unlocking. It is quite low. I think that at the chair's lowest vertical adjustment, it isn't low enough. I am left wanting another couple of inches as I feel I'm towering over my desk. All in all, I feel it's an okay chair for the money.

Otherwise, the price would seem quite high at around $24 for this set. You are really paying primarily for the pencils, which are a very good quality of water pencil and you also get a tear out book set of 8 fine detailed drawings you can color in. Overall, this is a good gift for the artist in your life, and is certainly one easy and relaxing way to feel a bit like a kid again...or, if you are still a kid, this is pretty great.

I've completed 3 digital scrapbooks (24 pages in each)in the short time I've owned this printer.  It handles my 3""x5"" photos just as beautifully as 12""x12"" photos.  Any scrapbooker would love this printer.  Be sure you review just how big this printer is.  The footprint is larger than any other printer I've had.  This printer also prints right onto CD's (you must buy special ink-jet CD's).  HP has a printer similar to this one, but only prints up to 11"" wide, and it does not have the ability to print on CDs - and the HP costs just a few dollars less than this Epson. Much more ""bang for the buck"" with the Epson R1800. Just a side note:  There are 8 ink cartridges, and of course, they won't all empty at the same time.  So I've purchased a couple extra of each (with a few more photo black).  I printed 400 4""x6"" photos before I had to replace a cartridge.  The cartridges retail for about $15 each - but I found a website that bundles 12 for about $67.

3382,4.0,My thoughts on this chair.,"Full transparency - Nobody is paying me to write this and I did not buy this chair from Amazon. I bought it locally and decided to write a review here just to contribute product information for those who need it.<br /><br /> I bought this chair because I saw it for a good price in a local store and it seemed very comfortable when I tried out the display (usually not really the best way to choose a chair because you really need to sit in it a long time to know how it will be over time).<br /><br /> Assembly - My first thoughts on just getting the chair home and out of the packaging were that this chair is heavier than it's size would suggest. I mean, this thing feels solid! I don't know if it's really heavier than your standard pleather office chair but I guess you just don't expect something that looks so lightweight to be heavy.<br /><br /> Assembly was relatively painless and straightforward. About what you expect for a modern office chair. I didn't run into any unexpected problems or missing parts. It took me about 45 minutes but I could have done it faster. I was just taking my time.<br /><br /> I haven't sat in it for very long periods (yet but will update this when I have) but it's pretty comfortable for short periods. I will mainly just be listing the cons I found....<br /><br />1. I am about 5' 9""  and I don't like to sit high. At it's lowest setting, my feet will only sit flat on the floor if I sit straight up with no recline. This chair does not raise my knees as much as some chairs do but it does raise them somewhat. I do not really like sitting 90 degrees straight up.<br /><br />2. Measure your desk height before you buy this chair. My keyboard tray is lower than the lowest position of the arms on this chair. And because the arms are attached to the seat back and the seat back is the part that reclines, the arms of the chair will tilt if you recline even slightly. This makes it very unpleasant to use with my desk and the only real solution is to raise the arms up entirely and not even use them when I'm typing or using my mouse. I'm sure they'd be great if my desk was higher but it isn't so they aren't. But it's a pro and a con. There are not many chairs available at this price point where you can entirely get the arms out of the way if you don't want to use them for some reason.<br /><br />3. After sitting in it for about an hour or so, I find my tailbone is a bit sore but this might just be me. My back has never been great and I have had this problem to one degree or another with every chair I've ever used.<br /><br /> Conclusion - For a relatively inexpensive chair, this is pretty good. It definitely beats out a lot of chairs that cost the same. I'm not entirely sure yet how I feel about the mesh but one good thing about it is that the mesh really can't ""bottom out"" for someone my size. With a cushion, if it bottoms out, you will eventually feel the hardness of whatever is under that cushion on your backside and tailbone and that hurts.",B08F14W9W2,Office_Products

Then, after building it I attempt to plug it in, it works but is very slow to and pauses after 10 seconds of decreasing ot increasing height increments.

3394,4.0,Easy to setup with the Mac software would get more attention.,"Brother generally makes pretty good products I have a networked laser printer and the QL-720NW from them. The QL-720NW is fairly easy to setup I used the ethernet connection as opposed to the wireless connection. Plug it in your DHCP router assigns it an IP my Mac picked up the printer as a Bonjour printer. You'll need to download 3 pieces of software from the Brother website:<br /><br />[...]<br />- Stand alone drivers<br />- Software updater which gives you firmware updates and more label templates for free<br />- P-touch editor which is the software for printing labels. (You'll need the last 9 digits of the serial number for your printer which is located on the bottom of the printer)<br /><br />You need the drivers the software updater and P-touch software are optional but I've never tried printing labels without P-touch. There's also an iOS app from the App Store you can download on your iPad/iPhone/iPod Touch. Once you've installed the drivers if you're on a Mac you can install the printer under system preferences, there's one small catch. Make sure you select the CUPS driver instead of the AirPrint driver because P-touch won't work with that AirPrint driver, if you make a mistake just remove the printer and re-add it with the CUPS driver (both drivers are installed when install the driver package).<br /><br />The P-touch software isn't very user friendly and I wish Brother spent as much time documenting how to use P-touch for Mac as they do for Windows. One of the things you probably want to do with this label printer is print mailing labels, P-touch can use the address book on your Mac.<br /><br />Here's where it gets confusing, if you want to make custom formats for your labels for example selecting certain fields from your address book or even combing fields you need to select Address book as the database than click ""Connect Fields"". Connect Fields lets you combine fields together and add any necessary punctuation for example commas and spaces in your addresses. After you've created your custom layout, you need to click database ""Merge into Layout"" scroll to the bottom of the list and select your layout. Great so now you see your custom layout on the label size it to what you want.<br /><br />You're probably wondering how you actually see a label with an address before you print it. The only way you can do this at least on a Mac is in print preview, the annoying thing is that you can't adjust any font sizes or resize anything in print preview you have to go back out and adjust it than print preview again until you get it right. BUT... you can in the iOS app, the downside to the iOS app is that there aren't as many layout options and the editor isn't as full featured but ti does get the job done for mailing labels.<br /><br />Brother please give the Mac and iOS app more attention. The printer is fantastic it's very fast.",B0081TZD54,Office_Products

A problem that I have is my office chairs eventually start to lose the softness of the cushioning. It's kind of like sitting on metal, so I usually add a chair cushion.<br /><br />I recently got a new office chair and I put 4 inch castors on it, so it would be more ergonomically aligned with my armrests and my desktop height. Works perfectly. I tried to use my old cushion with the new chair, but the thickness of the cushion made me sitting up too high. This thin pad was the perfect solution for my situation.<br /><br />It adds a little bit more cushioning without raising my height a noticeable difference.

3424,5.0,Beautiful Map and A+++ Customer Service,"I have to be honest here:  I bought this as a Christmas gift for my son who is currently on his first deployment in Afghanistan.  Needless to say after I ordered it and had it shipped to my home, it was wrapped and shipped around the world to his current station.  I was so excited as he had already traveled thru Europe in high school and given he is enlisted for 8 years this would help track all his travels.  I‚Äôve confirmed with him that he has never taken it out of the box yet as he wanted to wait until he is stateside to unbox it and appreciate what it was.  Just this past week I received an email from the company asking how I liked the product and if I would leave feedback.  I was honest and explained why I couldn‚Äôt but we would be happy to in a few months when my son is stateside again.<br /><br />My email was immediately followed up with a Thank you for my sons service and the man responding that he as well had served and they wanted to provide me with one for free.  I was blown away as I was simply stating we would need to wait and would happily give feedback once we could.<br /><br />He (Stanley) from Wanderlust not only sent me 1 for free but he sent 3 in total.  Really essentially 6. As there are 2 maps per box, one U.S. map and one world map.  Now each of my kids remaining at home can follow their brother and mark off all their travels in the U.S. as well.<br /><br />The box the maps come in is beautiful all in itself.  The quality of the map is durable as well as the coating to scratch each location.

3445,5.0,Lexmark makes quality printers!,"I have been using the Lexmark Interpret S405 for two months now and I love it!  I upgraded from another Lexmark all-in-one that I had for five years.  The old Lexmark served me well through college but at the end of its run, it started having technical problems and would only print/copy/scan when it was feeling like it.  I thought five years from a printer was definitely good quality so I wanted to stay with Lexmark.  I had heard about how inkjet printers were better quality and you would save money on ink.  I needed an all-in-one since I would be using it through graduate school.  This printer was under $100 and seemed to fit all of my needs with a few bonuses.  The wireless feature is splendid!  Yes, when I first set it up on my computer it did not want to work smoothly, so I went to Lexmark's website and updated all of the drivers.  This took about 10 minutes and the wireless network has worked perfectly ever since then.  One thing I have learned over the years is that as long as you update your drivers regularly, most electronic issues can be fixed quite easily.  I have printed out over 200 papers since I first received the printer with the ink cartridges included and am just now receiving a warning that the black ink is getting low.  I think that is decent for black ink.  The previous Lexmark printer I had cost about the same for ink.  Every two or three months I would need to replace the black ink for around $25 and every four to five months I would need to replace the color ink for around $30.  The color ink is still over halfway full on all colors and I have printed out more than fifteen pictures in the past month.  I like their recycle inkjet cartridge return program too.  You can have a postage paid return bag sent to your home and then you can ship the empty cartridge to Lexmark to help keep the cartridges from harming the environment.  I know that ink is expensive and I don't like that it is that high in cost, but I am pleased with the features and quality of this printer and I hope it lasts five years, just like my first Lexmark printer did!<br /><br />Update- 4/23/11:<br />Even though the printer said my black ink was getting low, I was able to print out about 300 more pages over the next few months. I now have to purchase color ink, but considering it has been 7 months I do not mind. I am completely out of the cyan, but I am still able to print with magenta, yellow, and black ink!  The loophole that others may have not found is simply to unplug the machine and let it reboot.  Then every time that you turn it on it will check the ink.  On the screen located on the front of the printer, it will say (for example) ""cyan ink is low"" just press OK.  Then it will go through any other cartridges that are low, again press OK for each.  Then it will print using only the available ink!  I hope that helps some people save money. :)",B002E9CAZI,Office_Products

3458,5.0,Teacher Review,"I normally don't review the things I buy on amazon, but after buying this and using it extensively for a classroom, I absolutely had to review this for anyone still doubting. Working with students in the 6 - 7 yr range, anything you're using over and over again absolutely must be laminated, or it will be destroyed. The things I laminated using this held up amazingly well - far better than the paper I had laminated onsite by the school.<br /><br />Pros:<br />Good quality plastic, very thick, holds up to bending and heavy use<br />Can be cut to make bookmarks or other shapes without peeling<br />Simple and easy to use<br /><br />Cons:<br />Slow!<br />Over heats after laminating about 40 consecutive sheets<br /><br />If you have the time and are looking for a laminator that's affordable, I would recommend getting this.",B08VG3RZ71,Office_Products

3461,5.0,Nice notebook with thick paper. Good for bullet journaling.,"Jumping onto the bullet (journal) train, I got this notebook after some &#34;extensive&#34; research for dot grid journals.<br />I'm not a fountain pen user, but my biggest concern was &#34;see-through&#34; pages (i.e. pens that didn't bleed onto the other side, but still left a visible shadow on the next page). I had been debating between this and the Leuchtturm 1917 and ultimately decided on this. My friend got the Leuchtturm before me and it was definitely more see-through than my Rhodia.<br />So I'm not going to say this was perfect because even if it did fare better than the Leuchtturm, I could still see a faint hint of my pens on the other side of the page.<br />Update 8/6: pictures featuring micron pens, mildliners, and colored pencils. not featuring: sharpie which definitely bleeds through. Muji pens and normal gel pens do not bleed. Mildliners bleed if you press too hard or color over one spot two or three times. The paper is also super smooth so not ideal for pencil sketching.<br />Also, maybe it's just my copy, but my dots weren't perfectly aligned. It's not noticeable unless you really look for it, but the space between the dots at the top of the pages to the edge of the paper was slightly smaller than the space between the dots at the bottom of the page to the edge. And this space would vary from page to page.<br />I'll still give it 5 stars since these are rather nit-picky details. This was a decent purchase. I see the price went up quite a bit since I purchased this for 17.50 though.",B0B151C3G7,Office_Products

The placement of components on the circuit board from the yellow case was different for the placement on the circuit board from the blue case.

The mat is easy to clean and it doesn't make things worse, but there's been no change in the amount of litter being tracked everywhere. I've ordered a different mat from a different company and am hoping that it will provide the service it promises.",B09K4J3RTR,Pet_Supplies

Also, I tried ordering a size 20 but for some reason it kept reverting back to size 14 so I figured that was the main product page that showed up in the cart no matter what size I order. In the end, as I was worried might happen, I got a size 14. Their &#34;hassle free&#34; return policy is designed to prevent customers from sending back their purchase. I was told that I can return it on my dime and pay a 20% re-stocking fee if I want a size 20.

3570,1.0,Product does not yield measurable changes--per its own labeling,I bought this at a Pets Mart in a somewhat urgent situation because the nitrogen cycle in our new tank did not seem to be developing correctly--ammonia was increasing and pushing 4ppm but nitrites and nitrates were not straying from zero or near zero. We put this stuff in the tank per instructions and noticed no change in ammonia levels. I am with the other reviewer who noticed on bottle that any reduction in dangerous ammonia will not be noticeable with testing because harmless ammonium (the resultant of using this product) still shows up as ammonia on testing--not what I was looking for. We use the API master fresh water test kit which appears to be a pretty good setup.  Our tank is a 1st grade classroom project that watches trout develop from eggs to parr before being released to a nearby mountain stream--right now we have +/- 200 pretty healthy-looking fry in a 60 gal tank and want to keep them that way to avoid 'emotional trauma' to our 1st graders who are becoming quite attached to the project.,B0972DL3PV,Pet_Supplies

Pity, because it looked like a good design.  Perhaps, if the rope-end of the bumper were solid (not hollow), fatter (less easy to be gnawed), and more cylindrical (instead of rectangular) , the rope-end would be sufficiently resistant to gnawing and keep the rope-end intact.<br /><br />BTW, gnawing of the end yielded small pieces of plastic that some dogs might swallow and be harmed.",B08KZQ39Q6,Pet_Supplies

3604,2.0,NOT MADE FOR MULTI-CAT HOUSEHOLDS - Clay litter haters - Find yourself a different litter,"NOT FOR MULTI-CAT HOUSEHOLDS.<br /><br />We gave this litter a shot because amazon no longer had World's Best in stock. If you at all have a problem with dust or cats tracking litter everywhere, please do NOT buy this product. It's expensive, and in our 4 cat household it only lasted 1 week and filled 2 litter boxes.<br /><br />Pros: - Cats really do love it. And sometimes a little bit too much. We saw a lot more throwing of the litter in our house than other brands.<br /> - It does manage to not have the usual strong pee odor of other clay litter brands (Tidy Cats esp). But still has a strong dust smell if you are asthmatic you'll want to avoid.<br />- Clumps great as advertised<br /><br />Cons: - Doesn't go far. 28lb bag is very dense so you'll be lucky to fill 2 large sized litter boxes with it.<br />- NOT FOR MULTI-CATS. Doesn't last long with high use - There are other brands that hold up better over time<br />- DUSTY - I don't care what the bag says, when your partner can't use their office anymore because of how dusty the one in the same room is then there's a problem. You'll almost always see a cloud of dust when you clean it.<br />- Non-flushable. After seeing how this clay reacts to water/pee don't put this stuff anywhere near your pipes<br />- Annoying to clean out of the pan when time comes to change the litter, requires quite a bit of scrubbing of the box<br />- Tracks absolutely everywhere. The clay is small and sticks to absolutely everything. I've never found so much clay tracked around my house, stuck to my socks, and stuck to my cats. Seriously, it was almost always stuck on their tails when they got out of the box. And we vacuum 2 TIMES A DAY with a Dyson stick vac around these boxes, and it's still a nightmare. We added easily 20min a day to our cleaning routine to compensate for this crap.<br /><br />Moral of the story:<br />If you have one cat with a box in a non-public place, go for it. I'm sure this would be fantastic litter for you. But if your cats love to throw litter, or you have Multiple, find something else. This is NOT going to be your friend and you'll be pulling your hair out at the end of a week with it.",B0B52GBV97,Pet_Supplies

I went to reorder, so I went up a size, to the mediums.  THEY ARE HUGE!  I really like how they stay on, but the small won't cover her entire claw, or even slide on all the way, and I can fit her entire paw in the medium size.  They aren‚Äôt even the same shape.<br />,",B07BNJR3N7,Pet_Supplies
3620,2.0,Unreliable Customer Service & Low Quality,"Breaks my heart to write this review as I've been a loyal Go-Cat customer for close to 10 years. I purchased a new wand on January 18th and now here we are, February 1st and the string has already broken. I've never had this happen before and on top of that I reached out to Go-Cat via their website asking if there was a service to replace the string or if there was a sort of tutorial I could follow with string purchased from them to no response.<br /><br />I'm frustrated I keep paying for a new wand when the string is the issue.<br /><br />Additionally, other cat-owners I've purchased this wand for complained of the knot that secures the feather head to the string as untying. I hadn't experienced that until recently, I suggest they add an 'O' ring of sorts and melt the string together, it's just unreliable.<br /><br />I'm truly disappointed in the product that in the past has worked beautifully. I think I'll have to take my business elsewhere :(",B07XC78K3P,Pet_Supplies

3623,2.0,"A beauty, but it doesn't work for everyone","The only thing they really had to get right with this tank was having the black bottom piece affixed securely to the clear acrylic tank, and with that they failed miserably. The black acrylic piece at the bottom is about 3/8"" wide and is affixed poorly by glue around the tank. Accidently bump into the table or attempt to move the table and the bottom will no longer be attached to the tank.<br /><br />The acrylic tank is square but once filled with water the sides protrude outwards, losing its shape, making it look much less square than when there is no water in it. Having a glass tank would have solved this problem. Also the acrylic is very vulnerable to scratches. When removing the rocks to clean it you must be VERY careful. If you scratch the sides of the tank, it will look cloudy and visibility will be permanently decreased. Had it been glass, this wouldn't have been a problem.<br /><br />Another thing, you must not use a heater otherwise the entire top will be foggy and you will not be able to see inside the tank. So for some, this may mean no tropical fish. If you aerate the water or cause motion in the water, you will find condensation underneath the glass top and it will bubble up and start dripping into the tank again. If you use the included carbon filter you will also have a cord running across the room to the nearest outlet. A light fits discreetly underneath the tank and the rocks do a good job of dispersing the light quite evenly, however you've got another cord. There is about a 6"" opening in the center of one of the black bottomed sides to easily slide in the light and remove it when necessary. The glass top is well made.<br /><br />Overall it's a beautiful piece, but it doesn't work for everyone.",B000R7ITUO,Pet_Supplies

3627,2.0,Formula has changed,"I've used this product for about three years, and the last 5 or 6 bags I've bought have been different.  This product is made up of two ""grinds"" of corn: a coarser grind like cornmeal, and a finer grind like cornflour.  The cornmeal is the real workhorse and clumps like no other litter out there.  But recently Worlds Best has changed the ratio of coarse to fine (even though when I asked them they denied any changes).  Now there is much less coarse, which is used up in the first couple of weeks.  Once the coarse is gone, what is left is a soft, powdery litter that does not hold a clump well.  If I want to dispose of a big scoop, without shaking and separating the clean litter from the clump, then yes, this powder is ok.  But if you want to jiggle the clean from the clump in the scoop, the clump falls apart.  This stuff is WAY too expensive to perform like that.  It's a shame, because the old formula was really awesome.<br /><br />Note to Worlds Best:  if it ain't broke, don't fiddle with it.",B07K2TJY1R,Pet_Supplies

Upon assessing the damage, I realized that the metal stops halfway inside the handle, and the rest of it is hollow plastic. The pressure from lifting heavy clumps of litter puts a lot of stress in that area unless you grip close to the scoop‚Äôs head. The breakage might be understandable if I had been using this scoop for several years, but I‚Äôve only had it for 4 months!<br /><br />I thought maybe I had a fluke experience, but it seems others have had the same problems.

It's just...two hours after this was placed in their bowls, it's still there.  Every last bit of it except the little bits of gravy they licked out of the dishes.  Now, you have to understand something about our cats.  Kitty number one, who we'll call Catzilla for our purposes here, is pretty much like the sister from Ever After.  He's only here for the food.  He will eat anything. ANYTHING.  Will lick refried beans out of an unwashed pan.  Will eat Cheetos, gold fish crackers, bugs, rug, artificial flowers...really, there's no limit to what he's willing to eat.  Except this.  He will not eat it.  I find it actually rather stunning given what he will eat and I've never seen him reject a food like this.<br /><br />His partner in crime, Sith Whispicus on the other hand, has more refined tastes.  But because Catzilla is usually trying to bully her out of her food, she's pretty eager, aggressively so, about anything you put in her dish these days.  Except this.  She too hates it.  Holy cow.  I'd give it one star, except there's nothing wrong with the product visually and it's possible your cat may like it. I don't plan on buying this one again, and I'm looking at these very full food bowls wondering what kind of diabolical damage my sweet kittypoos are going to subject me to in retaliation.

The first few times I did it, water got everywhere, because there's a dispensing spout on the bottom that sprays water if you don't get the jug in place exactly right.  I've kind of got the hang of it now, but it's still a chore I hate doing (and one I'll only do if I'm about to change my clothes anyway!)  ;-)<br /><br />What I really don't understand is why the top of the water station unscrews -- it makes it seem as though you can conveniently fill it from the top (while it sits in its stand) -- but you can't.  The black top cap just unscrews for no apparent reason...!?  I think this is an odd design point.<br /><br />That being said, my dog LOVES drinking out of this thing, and will pick it every time over an ordinary dish.

There were piles of leftover pellets. I had to get out the vac an hour after the first feeding.

3707,3.0,Not good for Betta,"I bought this tank about 5 months ago. I never write reviews- yet, as a new fish owner, the amount of research you have to do to give your fish a proper life is hard enough- then comes the tank selection.<br />Pros:<br />- the tank is aesthetically pleasing and sturdy<br />- very easy to set up and only had to buy decorative accessories and heater.<br /><br />Cons:<br />- Cleaning: I know this has been stated bc when I was reading reviews, I already knew about the problem before buying the tank- But for me, it's not so much the inconvenience of changing the filter at the bottom (which I was prepared to deal with), but the disruption to the fish and the tanks environment. The process of getting to the filter at the bottom causes a lot of particles to be released, forcing you to do a massive rearrangement of decorations to access the filter, and personally, caused the death of my first betta due to my own ignorance of how to clean the tank.<br /><br />- The pump/filter: it is very loud and harsh for the fish. Granted- this is again is something I knew about, and my own fault for not doing my research- However, definitely not suitable for a betta fish, nor any light swimming fish. As of now, I mostly have to have to cycle the filtration on/off to not stress my fish and allow them to enjoy the tank. When the filtration is on, the fish mostly hide in the corner of the tank<br /><br />- Lighting- basic on/off and no dimming capabilities. Very basic and suitable for resilient fish.<br />- Accessories: purchased some at first from the Biorb manufacturer- they were overpriced and the one I kept feel apart after 2 weeks.<br /><br />Overall, I'm in the process of getting a better tank and system for my fish. But I would definitely not recommend this tank, because it's genuinely not worth it.",B0BL32QVCW,Pet_Supplies

My girl sheds quite a bit because she rubs herself into everything after being brushed, so I was careful to keep the fountain as clean as I could with this in mind. Despite that, the fountain still ended up being clogged constantly and it was not very easy to clean. The water flow was already pretty meager and using the filters it came with made the fountain less functional. Despite my best efforts, the flow of the spout eventually stopped working because of how difficult the motor was to reach in order to clean it and I ended up tossing it. The best I was able to do (outside of trying to squeeze a scrubby pad in there) was swipe my finger along the motor when I took the guard off in the main well of the fountain. The fountain itself is pretty quiet, though, which was nice. Overall, it's not bad, but I wouldn't buy it again, especially with how weak the flow was.",B00G15EGOE,Pet_Supplies

Unfortunately for us, I noticed one of my dogs started chewing her rear and scratching her ears and it only became worse as the days went along and.  I gave it a full 2 weeks, and after baths, freshly clean bedding, and making sure we didn't have any exterior factors (fleas, mosquito, typical dog issues in Texas) we went back to one of their old foods (We switch between Call of the Wild and Victor Grain free).  Within 24 hours the scratching and chewing was at least 50% better and a full week later we had zero chewing or scratching.<br /><br />I had such high hopes for this new food.  unfortunately for us it was not a good fit.<br /><br />***I gave the leftovers to a guy at work and his Rottweiler loved it and had/has no issues.

No matter how many times it sprayed him, he pretty much ignored it.  It did not make him bark any more (or any less).

I was hoping my cat would snuggle in the bag and I could wrap it around him. Nope. I tried with an 18 pound cat and an 8 pound cat.

It's the size of a golf ball and worked like a charm right out of the box in my test scenario.  The issue arose when I tried to set it up for my ATO configuration.  I keep a 5 gallon container in a small dorm fridge which i use to topoff and cool my 180, the fridge sits on the opposite side of a wall next to my tank, total distance for a cable run is about 8 ft (6ft cable included and 29.00 for an extension). that was problem #1, Problem #2 is this should come with an option for an inline pump, this way people with ATO's already plumbed can tie in to the line closer to the controller and avoid issues with reach.  Problem #1 solved by ordering a longer cable from amazon which i then had to replace one end so it fit the thicker connector end. Issue #2 resolved by drilling a small hole in the side of the fridge and running the connector out.  All in all i really enjoy it.<br /><br />UPDATE: removed the focusing lens for quarterly cleaning and noticed the plastic was being pushed apart by rust...NOT COOL!, quickly called CoralVUE and a replacement magnet is on it's way, will probably silicone around the seal until i upgrade to a TUNZE..",B00HFR8KPI,Pet_Supplies
3767,3.0,search continues for a decent heater,"I think it's pretty much impossible to find a decent aquarium heater. I don't understand why it's so hard to put a decent thermostat in these.

I get it that there's not enough space to write every number from 65 to 89 or whatever, but the intervals are different. Sometimes they increase by 2 and sometimes by 3.<br />2. Heater is not consistent. It will not hold a consistent temperature. I needed to increase the temp of my tank to 85 to treat ich and once I seemingly got it there the heater would on some days malfunction and heat to a good 3 degrees hotter.<br />3.The indicator on the front of heater is not the actual temperature of your tank it's just whatever temp the heater is set to. Not very helpful.<br />4. I asked the manufacturer the size of this item and they replied with the completely wrong dimensions (by 2 inches) This means it did not fit in my tank the way I expected it to. So obviously their employees don't really know that much about their products.<br /><br />I wish I could recommend something else but I've been through a lot of heaters (both of this type and inline) and I haven't found a brand that has a decent product.",B00ODZM4ES,Pet_Supplies

When I pulled it out, my wife thought that we have purchased a stuffed American flag. I'm not saying that this is a bad thing, but I definitely felt a bit weird seeing my cat sleeping on an American flag on your floor (but that could just be me). The real issue is that the sides are really tall making the bed very deep. Our dog is medium to small and she likes to see everything that happens. This made it difficult for her to see out which meant that she didn't use it that often. We ran into the same situation with our cats. Overall, I think that this would work best for small to medium animals who like to really slumber without having to see around them.

We watch his feed closely but he still would several times a week get a sour stomach and vomit, and sometimes he'd have loose stools. It was suggested to place him on a probiotic and multivitamin. We decided to try these vitamins several months ago. Since beginning them, his sour tummy trouble is a rare occurrence! And no more loose stools either. I highly recommend. My only problem is that he's not crazy about the taste. I bought the chicken flavor and am going to get the peanut butter ones and see if he likes those any better since half the time I have to put a little peanut butter on them to make him eat it. My in-laws dog was having some tummy issues too, and I gave their dog one to see if he'd eat one, and he spit it out.

Also, if you are not using a guard they cut down to almost the skin-which was ok because I was going for a lion cut and I wanted it very short.

3815,4.0,Good for outdoor use in mild or partly wind/rain-sheltered conditions.,"This is great for indoor use and even for outdoor areas that are relatively sheltered from weather (rain and wind) that don't need perfect heat efficiency. I installed it in a panel in the window of a garage and kitty loves it. I'd give it five stars but the quality of the plastic lock is kind of poor. The detent on mine is bad and it doesn't always line up with the door edge like it should. For my purposes this doesn't matter much though because I almost never lock it, but if you need to use the lock on a daily basis I would recommend buying a more expensive and better quality pet door because the lock on this seems likely to break or wear out with daily use. It's only good for occasionally locking the cat out when he's determined to interfere with sawing wood or hammering nails for example.<br /><br />You can teach a cat to use this in less than an hour by luring him through it with cat treats. At first, hold the door open and lure him back and forth in both directions. Lure them through in both directions so they'll remember going through the opening on each side. Then lure him back and forth but drop the door on his back (not on his head because it will hit his forehead whiskers making him think something of unknown weight is coming down on his head). After doing that a few times, try luring him through it without opening it for him. Open it slightly so he can see it moves. He will start clawing at the edges of it trying to pull it open first but eventually he'll try pushing on it. Shake the bag of treats to provide more motivation. Lure him back and forth two or three times and that's it. At first they'll hesitate a bit before pushing it open but in a day or two they'll be running right through it like its not even there.",B09YDBGZ15,Pet_Supplies

3818,4.0,Pretty decent tank! Crappy filter.,"Excellent for my betta. For those other reviewers spouting nonsense about how bettas should only be kept in 2+ gallon tanks - go ahead and do a quick internet search of wild bettas. They live in literal puddles with less water than a sports drink. This tank is pretty darn roomy and my betta Neil has been blowing happy bubbles for the couple months since I bought it. Don't expect the filter to do anything however, it's leaving a strange film on the top of the tank. The film wasn't there in the old tank so I can only assume it's from the dubious &#34;bio filter&#34;. I very much wish the light and the filter weren't on the same power supply so I could just switch the silly thing off but at least it gives a gentle stream for Neil to swish around in. For the price it really is pretty great, just buy a new filter if you plan on having any other fish than a betta.",B001MYJZRC,Pet_Supplies

However, her spirit is still great; thank God!!<br />This product I believe was a good addition with the other supplements that she takes (4 capsule of 1000mg fish oil daily/turmeric (99 %) and  Duralactin). By adding this,  we are was able to take her off prescription tabs at night as I believe it worked in conjunction with the other supplements I mentioned.  Remember that I said on a scale of 1 to 10 she was a 15, which her vets says she is chronic. I would say that it moved her to a 12.  She still can't go for walks as she once did less than a year ago, do stairs/steps. I would buy another bottle, but due to her size it last for about 3 weeks and it's on the costly side. So I'm going to try another supplement to see if it can maybe move her to an 8.

The mourning doves collect on the patio floor to eat what gets kicked out of the feeder and when the feeder is empty the sparrows, and cardinals pick up the left-overs on the ground.

3836,4.0,PUTTING AN END TO DESTRUCTION!,"I decided to try a kitty door.  One of our cats has destroyed over six screens.  I ordered the door spoke to our screen man and explained the situation.  He created a screen using heavy duty Pet Mesh way thicker than our previous screen mesh.  Our screen man used three bars and the side of the screen frame to bolster the screen Pet Door.  We used a much wider extruded aluminum frame for the new screen.  The frame material is what they use for sliding screen doors so it is way wider and heftier than regular window screen frames.  The screen itself had a heavy duty Pet Screen Mesh, so we thought we were fine...HA!<br /><br />In one week our cat ripped a hole through the actual swinging Pet Door.  The Pet Door is a fine mesh and I did not think about that!  I called our screen man and asked if he had any extra heavy duty Pet Mesh left.  He was great he delivered a small roll of the super strong pet mesh.  The moral of this tale is learn from my mistake; if I had known what I know now, I would have taken some preventative measures.  It's never too late to remedy the situation.<br /><br />I used newspaper and made a template of the swinging pet door.  I cut two pieces of the heavy duty indestructible Pet Mesh.  I used heavy duty leather thread and hand sewed the heavy duty Pet Mesh to each side individually.  We now had the original thin mesh which was sandwiched between the two pieces of indestructible Pet Mesh.  See the AFTER pictures.  The main thing is she has freedom to come and go and we have stopped the destructive behavior of ripping up screens.  We also changed out the screens she has access to using the heavy duty Pet Mesh.",B07H922DZP,Pet_Supplies
3837,4.0,Cage has some good points and some bad points.  The good may outweigh the bad.,"This bird cage &#34;will do&#34; for now for short road trips between the house the bird lives at and the pet sitter.  However, the instructions to put this cage together were poor and I had to get them off the website because the instructions and parts were trapped in the folded cage and could not be reached until the cage was put together.  The cage might have been easy to put together except that 2 sides were stuck together in a way that they were not meant to go.  It took pliers to get them apart.  The door &#34;locking&#34; mechanism does not really lock.  A bounce could easily move the mechanism out of the lock.  I will have to tie them together.<br />9/4/16  Further problems.  The included wooden perch is too large and smooth for the parakeet.  Also, the perch will not stay attached to the sides of the cage because the perch is just slightly too short.  The included steel dishes are nice dishes, but far too large for the cage.<br />9/10/16 This is a very sturdy cage.  The bars are strong.  When the cage is opened up it does not come apart.  The cage would be very hard to tip over.  These are very good things for a road trip.  The prior issues do still stand, but can be handled.  None of the otherr cages you could travel with were this sturdy or this hard to tip.  So I am upping the review to 4 stars.",B003VVP0KU,Pet_Supplies

The bells are fine, but they make noise each time I open the door and my nephew has learned to pull open the door with the string of bells... and that is dangerous.<br />So here we find my solution through Mighty Paw. The touch pad (for dog nose/paw) can be placed anywhere with included adhesive pads or mounting screws. The receiver (door bell) just needs to be plugged into a standard outlet. The dogs will learn rather quickly how to activate the bell, as it isn't hard. There are over 30 different doorbell sounds a few volume levels as well - so totally customizable! I like that the various volumes as it is true I sometimes didn't hear our old bell.<br />The touch pad is very sensitive so even the slightest push triggers it. Great for sog owners without a dog door. Best way to train your dog to use it would be to teach them to shake and hit it or put peanut butter or something on it and they will nudge it with their nose.",B073XCBMNK,Pet_Supplies

I prefer the cedar scent, but it can be overpowering when you are doing a full carpet treatment indoors.  The outside concentrate is great and very effective.  For indoors I'll put it in a pump sprayer canister for full carpet application as it's easier on the hands than using a pump sprayer that comes with the gallon container.  In between it's also great for maintenance in hot spot areas.  Downside.. for laminate or vinyl floors, it can be slippery, and does leave an oil residue that you end up having to steam clean up.

3846,4.0,WE GAVE IT FOUR ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ RATING! NICE PRODUCT!,"The ropes were comparable to other avian toys that we've purchased on Amazon, maybe a bit thicker rope structure. As to the colored wood, it seemed the same (possibly pine?) as to most either bought on Amazon, or in stores such a PetSmart.<br /><br />My Umbrella Cockatoo, Mike the Lap Chicken is eight years old now, and of course ""Daddy's Bird"" in more than one way; Though not certified as of yet, he helps me handle some pretty severe PTSD from being a first responder Paramedic at the Pentagon on 9/11. Strangely though  after comforting me during my trying  episodes, Mike appears to take some of his own aggression on this toy we purchased. It is holding up very, very well so far, too! Only a few small rope pieces have been chewed through, and maybe some splintering of the colorful wood blocks. Mike's ""condo"" as we call it is fairly big, so he was plenty of room to take turns chewing and playing on this purchased toy,  then over to his ropes and ending up totally destroying a special heavy replaceble cardboard toy that I make special for him.<br /><br />All in All, my dear Lap Chicken loves it, and I would be comfortable in recommending it for birds his size. If I had to pick a negative, I would've liked to have seen the wood be just a tad harder to make him work a bit more at it. But, this has it's own negative conotation because I've found the harder the wood on the toy, the faster he would loose interest in it and move to something else you don't want chewed up. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è üòè<br /><br />In closing, if you have a cockatoo, a severe Macaw, Eclectus or any bird of this size- it would be just fine!

3854,4.0,"Already assembled and ready to hang. portable, can be moved around. Expensive","This is the first hanging cat tree I have seen, so I was really curious to see how it worked. It comes preassembled with all '4 stories' together in a single piece. You only need to take two clamp/hooks and hang over the top of the door and then hang the tree on the clamps. If a more secure fit is needed, then there is a tie and strap to make it more secure. the package also includes rubber grommets that install between the door and the clamps to 1) limit noise from cats jumping on it; and 2) limit any scratches on the paint on the door. However, because the selling point of this unit (for me) was portability, I decided to simply use the hooks without the grommets or straps. That way I can move it from one room to another, to keep the cats occupied and hopefully not too troublesome during at home work meetings. It is high (which cats love) and soft, so it is quite functional and perhaps it should be in every cat owners bag of toys, but I am not thrilled about the price. I sometimes deduct 2 stars from reviews when a product is very far from the expected value/price-point. And I ALMOST deducted a second star. However, not everyone cares about value as much as I do, and the functionality and thoughtful design deserves the remaining 4 stars.",B08ZBT2GS2,Pet_Supplies

Since I have an older dog that uses steps alot, and a new puppy just learning about steps, watching both types of dogs preferring to be lifted and/or jumping up and down instead of using these steps, speaks volumes.

The following couple of times were $84. Now it is $94,(Sub and save prices). The price keeps going up for the same size bag (30 pound). I'm switching food brands for that reason. I do use their cat food too and that has increased as well. If you don't care about price it is a good dog food and cat food. I got my pets from shelters and they had tummy troubles.

She just loves everything to death, especially if it squeaks. Still giving 4 stars because she had such a good time with it. Once she got the squeakers  and most of the stuffing out of it, I took out the rest and sewed it back together. She still loves it, even though it doesn't talk t her anymore!",B07D2VNDKB,Pet_Supplies

3889,4.0,Works for us,It‚Äôs pretty stinky but we are OK with that. That‚Äôs what attracts dogs do it. I don‚Äôt like that it is scanned and packaged in Vietnam when it advertises Iceland.

3890,4.0,Kind of works!,"So it does mask the pet scent lingering in room immediately upon spraying it. However, it does not resolve the pet smell for an extended period of time. So if you want to freshen up the room quickly when someone rings the doorbell then yes the product works. I cannot say that it neutralizes the pet smell for hours. I can spray the house at night and still have spray when I wake up. Then I burn a soy candle. I have an awesome Olde English Bulldogge. I deep clean every weekend but it is what it is; I have a pet!

It also seems to resist the clumping litter from sticking to the pan which is an added plus. I am very happy with my purchase.<br /><br />The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 was because the picture shows a tan colored pan and I received a blue one which doesn't match as well in my bathroom.  I didn't return it because it wasn't a big deal, but description should state &#34;that you may not receive the color shown.&#34;",B0027JF0NO,Pet_Supplies

3906,5.0,Great tool for nail grinding,"Great nail grinder for dogs.  It is not too heavy, easy to hold and maneuver, and quiet at the lowest setting.  I don't use the nail guard.  The 60-grit sanding disk that was supplied is way too coarse and causes the sanding disk to skip and jump when trying to grind the nails.  Order the Dremel 445 240-grit sanding disks instead.  They work great!  I have two fidgety beagles, so nail trimming is a two-person job for me.  I might invest in a grooming arm to make my life easier.  This Dremel has all the functionality of the corded Dremel in my shop but, being cordless, is much more convenient.  The unit is well made and I expect that it will last much longer than the cheap nail grinders I have purchased in the past.  Good purchase!",B0C49PVQC5,Pet_Supplies
3907,5.0,My cat loves this!,"My cat is very picky about what material she likes for her scratching pad. She loved the one I used to get her from PetSmart but they apparently stopped making it. Enter the Starryfield Cat Scratcher Mat. It took some digging to find one she would use but she absolutely loves this thing! There are feathers on rope cords attached to the bottom of the mat that stick out of two corners and the center hole. As you can see from the picture, the feathers on the outside corners didn't last long. That's not a ding on the mat, my cat just loves/hates feathers and goes nuts to get them off of her stuff. I'm really glad I was able to find this mat because it keeps her from scratching my furniture. I would definitely buy this mat again.",B07VGT5J51,Pet_Supplies
3908,5.0,WOW!,"I have a 1.5yr old Tuxedo cat. Her fur was getting drab and shaggy looking, and she was constantly constipated. Hard little pellets left behind in her litter box. She's a picky eater, only eats one brand of cat food (dry), hates treats, and I was having to smear Vaseline on her legs in order to get her more ""greased up"" so to speak. I decided to try these probiotics on a whim, and I am glad I did! I mix it in with her dry food, and she actually eats it! Within a week, her fur has gone from drab and dull to shiny and fluffy. Her eyes are bright. Her poops are dark brown and longer in size. Her hayfever is even better! She doesn't hork mucus all the time now. She only horks about once a day to clear her nose and throat. Anyway, I bought the probiotics here to test them out, and I am so pleased after one week, I went to Skoon's website and added them to my litter subscription. Anyway, she's a whole new cat now. So pretty, soft, and shiny. She's very active and gives me a load of sass.",B08CQ78X6G,Pet_Supplies

3933,5.0,"Went into it with hesitation, but finally an answer for my rescue dog","See posted picture to see the report. I avoided uploading a picture until I received the report to prevent any sort of fudging on the data.<br /><br />I was a genetics major in undergrad, and still I went into this a little skeptical. What if the genetics came back as a poodle mixed with pit bull. I rescued my girl about 1 year ago, and always had wondered what she was a mix of - German Shepherd, Husky, Border Collie, Shiba Inu, American Eskimo...and always got asked when I walked her. I always wanted to know, and finally after someone at the dog park told me ""she must be an x-y-z"" or something ridiculous, I decided to take 60 bucks and order the test.<br /><br />I knew in the end, 60 dollars is not that much. I'm a huge believer in Genetic analysis. And the worst that could happen is she comes back a total mutt and I have to deal with people still saying she looks like a rat mixed with a pigeon or something crazy.<br /><br />So got the test, shipped to me in less than 2 days (love PRIME), and made sure to keep her toys/food/water away from her overnight -- swabbed her mouth in the AM and sent off the sticks. Super easy instructions and she tolerated it pretty well.<br /><br />Within 2-3 weeks I had the report, and low and behold it was legit! I then uploaded a picture and made it complete. Very interesting...I never had considered a Sheltie in her mix, but now it makes sense why she is so small.<br /><br />I'm happy...and now I can tell people she's a Husky/Sheltie mixed with mutt. :)",B004GFN2ZA,Pet_Supplies

3939,5.0,My Cat Approves,"My cat seems to enjoy this cat bed, however I have a couple of observations to share. The first is that the center portion, where the cat is meant to lay, is quite humped with filling and slopes down to meet the sides. When I ordered it, I pictured my kitty sinking into the bed but given the design, this only happens when she lays on the sloped side, at which point, the bed does comes up around her a little. Second, I ordered the 20 inch bed for my average sized cat, and when she's off to the side, another typical cat could easily fit in this with her. So if you're on the fence about sizing, I would say that the 20"" bed should work for most cats. Overall, this is not quite what I had hoped for but since my cat seems to be happy with it, I am happy too. My advice would be to look closely at all of the pictures to get the best sense of how this bed is designed.",B08DV2SS9F,Pet_Supplies

3958,5.0,Only food we use.,"* Let me start by saying. If this is the first time feeding your dog this food or any new food, you must phase it in slowly otherwise your dog might get sick , vomiting or diarrhea...( slowly transition them to the new food by cutting it with the old food, slowly over time increasing the new food. We did this over over the course of a month...increasing on a weekly basis. Our dogs have sensitive stomachs)<br />I have 3 dogs from adults to senior . Also weights 5lbs to 30lbs.<br />This food works for everyone.  Our dogs are grazers, so we leave 3 bowls around the house in different  locations, they eat when they want. Luckily our dogs arent over eaters.( 3 bowls is to cut down on territorialism )<br />After opening the bag I put in cambro containers to keep it fresh, works well and keeps it from getting stale.",B0BGM4YC4P,Pet_Supplies

All of my neighbors were feeding my dog while I was at work, they all loved him so much and thought that he looked hungry.  Well of course he looked hungry he is a labrador they are ALWAYS hungry.  When you have 5 different people feeding your dog he's going to get fat.  I feed him 1.5 cups in the a.m. and the same at night.  Some people were feeding him left over spareribs, the other would put something like 8 cups in his bowl, I found this about 3 times, before he could get it all down.  I have been feeding him this food for about two months now and he absolutely LOVES it.  It is like a treat for him, he is loosing weight and beginning to look great again.  He still weighs 120 so that means he had to be at 130, no wonder I thought that he looked like a beached whale.  He is very happy getting his fat dog food in the a.m. and in the p.m. and maybe a treat or two during the day.

3981,5.0,13 yo Springer w/ cerebellum tumor,"I purchased these back in Feb 2013 for my 13 year old English Springer.  She went downhill in February after being physically & mentally amazing up to that point. She showed signs of losing more hearing & a tilted head.  Vet first diagnosed ear infection (dog never had one in her life) and when that didn't clear up, she said vestibular syndrome.  This didn't seem plausible, as her only symptom was the head tilt & slight unsteadiness.  In early February she began to roll whenever she was intent on something.  She would just fall over & roll and we would have to physically stop her.  She would be alert during the whole thing & fine as soon as we stopped her.  Rolling is a sign of a brain tumor.  Since we ruled out everything else, we assume from her symptoms that she has a cerebellum tumor. She had one weekend that she wouldn't leave my carpeted living room, had to be hand fed because her metal bowl scared her (noise)and had to be carried out to pee, as going out through the garage sent her into rolling.  She got better, but still had rolling episodes until I got these pills.  I didn't expect them to help, but within a week her rolling ceased and she never had another episode until last week.  I do not know if these pills are why she has been able to function, but I will not stop them until the end.  Cerebellum tumors screw up coordination, hearing & sight, it's more sensory perception etc.  Her coordination & such are definitely getting worse, but I have had 4 months more with her than I ever thought I would have judging by that weekend in February.  I would highly recommend them for any neurological problem.  I also give them to my 11 year old Springer, just in case!",B0C6QQXSZZ,Pet_Supplies

Three months ago, the motor went out on the one I had and this time when I ordered a new replacement I made a change to the device that has dramatically increased its efficiency.  The biggest problem the LM980s have is litter sticking to the rake and the bottom of the pan, leading the motor to work extra hard to try and clear the box and often causing it to jam up.  This leads to me having to continually clean it by hand it ensure it keeps working.  To the rescue came [[ASIN:B00DNQBFAW Rust Oleum 274232 Never Wet Multi Purpose Kit]].  For under $20, and in less than 10 minutes, I was able to coat the pan and rake with a protective barrier that has virtually eliminated my sticky litter problem.  In the three months since I sprayed on the moisture-proof surface, my new litterbox has not jammed a single time as wet litter can no longer stick to the plastic.

It appeared to be well designed and sturdy. It worked great -- until it didn't. It failed in less than 5-weeks! I don't know what caused the failure. I had used it with an oscillating spindle sander, a strip/disk stander, a router, and my table saw and it worked fine on all of them for extended periods. Wehn I realized it quit working,  After clearing the sawdust from my glasses, I inserted a line separator in  the power line and measured the current draw with a clamp-on ammeter. With both the saw and shop  vacuum running, the highest reading was 13.8-amps. I don't doubt the saw would draw more under load, but I didn't feel safe pushing a board through the saw while reading the ammeter. I went to the DGCproducts.com website and left a message, explaining the problem. More than a week went by without a response of any kind. I tried again Two weeks later, there still has been no response from the manufacturer. IMHO not responding to customer requests is worse than the fact that it failed.

In the 2 sensors that I tested, both were off in temperature by > 5 degrees F, with both reading higher than actual.<br /><br />According to the datasheet the maximum measuring time at 12 bits is 16ms; however, if running in No Hold mode, a signal for temperature is not returned for over 40ms. Humidity reads &lt; 16ms. In my tests, it took between 40 and 50 milliseconds to receive a response. This may cause some libraries (for si7021) to not work correctly.<br /><br />This device shares the same I2C address as all the other variants, at 0x40. If sent the command for identification, it returns 0x32, which is the ID for the Si7050 - however upon inspection of the datasheet for the HTU21, it appears this command is not supported, or at least not listed.<br /><br />Overall, it's nothing that should be used in anything serious.

When I did, the filter and a couple of other parts simply broke as I was installing them, but the ones I needed were okay.  I mounted it on the wall beside my tank and filter system.  The next day it was on the floor. The boat had not moved. The rubber bracket broke, weird, so I ordered another, carefully installed it.  Took the boat out a couple times but it's a big boat and no bouncing.  Noticed a couple weeks ago it was on the floor again, ordered another, this time installed it on the floor. Turned it on and it pumped fine but surged and surged, drawing lots of amps until it blew the breaker. The pressure switch is probably damaged from the fall and easily replaced, but it could be something else and I'm tired of screwing with it and will buy another brand.",B07QL9WFCX,Industrial_and_Scientific

When you are reaching 90% of the target torque value, an intermittent buzzer will start to warn you.""  and then ""2. When the target torque value is reached, a high frequency buzzer will warn you not to pull further.""  Neither of these statements appear to be true.<br /><br />Watch the video I posted.  I set the wrench to 13 ft lbs and then tighten a bolt.  It starts beeping at over 14 ft lbs and then goes to a solid tone at 15.7 ft lbs.<br /><br />People tell me: ""the difference between 13 ft lbs and 15 ft lbs is almost nothing""  and they also say ""just watch the display while you are wrenching"".  Sure both of those things are true, but why bother even having a beep setting if you have to watch the display?  Why bother with a torque setting at all if the wrench is going to ignore it and beep at some unknown value past your setting?<br /><br />Due to a shipping issue I ended up with 2 of these wrenches.

I decided to test this by lightly rubbing the hammer head on a paper towel. Sure enough, with some light rubbing, the material began to rub off. It is as if it is constructed of the same material used to make pencil erasers. The end on mine is not sharp as others have stated, although I would not suggest this device. I have taken it out of my bag as I do not want my other supplies or my bag to be stained by the head. I also will not be using this on my patients considering that I do not know the composition of the material used to make the head. I would not want to use toxic materials on my patients.

I purchased this machine for work, entirely because of the increased longevity of the screen and for the 30ish% faster total print times. They delivered on the speed for sure, but the LCD had already failed at less than 1/2 of the time of my Photon on a standard RGB LCD. I have been in the run around phase with Phrozen now trying different firmware for 2nd and third times because their Customer Service is not particularly bright, they def hired out and don't have ppl on staff who actually are doing troubleshooting. I only got experimental firmware from a friend who an in with the company, else i would have just been in the same loop with the Facebook ppl of please reflash the 1.6 firmware which is on our website, which is the equivalent of telling me to turn it on and off again.<br /><br />I am more than willing to be flexible and try novel solutions, i am not willing to be put into a run around, not when there is other hardware.<br /><br />If you get ANY stringing on the LEFT side of your build-plate within your Amazon return window just contact Amazon and return the unit. It is a death sentence once the stringing starts it does not stop, it gets worse an worse an will eventually ruin every plate you attempt to print.<br /><br />I should never have reached out via FB, i try to be a reasonable customer, that was my mistake, this stupid run around time caused me to fall outside of my own return window and now I am stuck with a defective machine in the actual week I need it for work. Fortunately I have a replacement Epax on the way that will arrive Thursday, but I will have lost a week of productivity because of this.<br /><br />If you are a hobbyist this is a fine machine, if you are in production, spend more money and buy something that will be more reliable. Do not risk your business on this is my strong suggestion.<br /><br />Phrozen knows this and can't seem to find a fix.<br /><br />It prints 4x faster than my photon, which I still love.

See in the picture, the multimeter (correct) reading is off by .1V.<br /><br />It would be one thing if the product was listed as accurate to .1V, but it is listed as .01V and this is not true.<br /><br />Another thing: based on the other reviews this listing used to be a much smaller load tester.

Not a big deal, but just an FYI.<br /><br />I was excited about having this but I found it to be off by about 4-6 degrees, depending upon the temp range it was shooting at. I happened to have a more basic IR Thermometer (True Power) which I deem to be accurate by testing things which have a known temperature, such as boiling water or an ice cube. So I tested these side by side and found the aforementioned deviation between the two. So in order to be fair, as an avid cook with a very expensive instant read meat probe, I rested the tip of the meat probe on a hot pan full of boiling water and did the same with a glass full of ice cubes, in order to establish an accurate baseline. The True Power was within one degree of the meat probe on both counts, but the Mestek was 4-5 degrees lower. So bottom line is that if you need really accurate readings, this tool will not provide that. Although I still love that full color LCD screen.",B09VKT1JNR,Industrial_and_Scientific
4171,2.0,Not for commercial use.,"I've owned a breakfast restaurant for 10 years.  I've learned over that time that I HATE waffle makers.  They just don't hold up to commercial use, the top or bottom element dies.  WOW, I just looked at my Amazon purchase history and I've purchased 19 Waring waffle makers since 2006, and 16 other brands including, Gold Medal, Star, Carbon, and Kitchenaid.  These units have ranged in price from $800 down to $99.  After the $800 units die in a few months,  I vow to never get burned again and I buy the $99 units that vary in life from 2 weeks to 2 months.  Then after 5 or more of the $99 units die  I think that maybe I should try the $800 units again.  So this time I thought I'd try this unit here, the Waring Commercial WW200 - which is mid way between the $800 and $99 units.  I bought this unit in September of 2013.  It died in January 2014.  (side note - I purchased the extended warranty on this machine for $37.98 - guess what?  That warranty doesn't kick in until AFTER the Waring warranty expires - I've never had a Waring unit make it to 6 month mark)  Ok- back to the story.  So this unit died in January 2014.  I had to call Waring who DID send out another unit promptly - thank you.  TODAY... that unit died, and I'll call Waring in a minute.  So... the bottom line for this review is this.  If you use these units for your home, you are &#34;golden&#34;.  If commercial, expect about 2 months.<br />I wish Waring would let me buy a case of elements - then I could start fixing the 19 bad units (kidding, I don't keep them) and save a ton of money - wait a minute...

4187,2.0,"If you want years of service out of your french drain, buy the real corrugated perforated pipe.","I was very disappointed with this product.  Especially after reading all of the 5 star reviews.  Discount the people who gave it bad reviews because they didn't know what perforated means, and there is only one other guy who wrote about how poor the quality was.<br /><br />When I first got it out of the box it felt strong and looked the part of a french drain pipe.  However, I immediately thought it looked small.  Regular corrugated pipe you buy in a roll at a hardware store is labeled by the inside diameter of the pipe.  This product however is 4 inches measured to the outer diameter when collapsed.  Since this is shaped like an accordion, there is less than 3 inches inside diameter.  I put it next to my existing 4&#34; corrugated pipe and I was shocked by the difference in size (see picture).  It is very misleading to label this a 4 inch pipe.  Their description of &#34;Compatible with most traditional 3-inch and 4-inch corrugated pipe and 4-Inch PVC&#34; is also incorrect.  None of my 4 inch corrugated pipe connectors would work with this because the Flex-Drain outer diameter is more than an inch smaller.<br /><br />Next up is the most important part, its strength.  In the description it states &#34;30-Percent higher load-bearing rating than standard corrugated pipe&#34;.  The &#34;strong&#34; feeling it had went away when it was expanded.  The plastic on these pipes is thin enough that as I was pulling it to its full length it started to collapse under the tension (see pictures).  A standard corrugated pipe can handle a lot of weight, and I can easily stand on it with no problems.  I could collapse the Flex-Drain with my hand.  I know this because I tried to get the collapsed parts to come back out but ended up having more of the pipe collapse.  This is a big issue because french drains are meant to be buried.  This means weight of the ground surrounding it and the objects that roll over that ground will compress this pipe.  Moreover, roots will crush it.<br /><br />Finally, the perforations are very roughly cut into the plastic leaving rough melted plastic around all of the holes.  This catches the sock while expanding and can rip it.  This is by far the smallest issue, but overtime I could see the rough edges gathering debris and slowing the speed it takes in water.  Standard perforated corrugated pipe has smooth slits.<br /><br />I know what you are thinking. &#34;Hey, if you disliked it so much why the two stars?? Why not one?&#34;.  Well, I can see this being used for very small projects where you don't want to lug the heavier corrugated pipe, you don't expect to have much weight on it, and you don't need years of life out of it.<br /><br />However, if you are like me and want your french drain to last as long as possible, then spend the ten more dollars and get the real corrugated pipe.  After all those back breaking hours digging the trench and filling it with gravel, I don't want to even think about doing it again.",B004LVP83I,Industrial_and_Scientific

4205,3.0,"Suction only works for ""certain"" kinds of choking, not for elderly, not to be used if you‚Äôre alone","Hi, I got this for my elderly father who almost died from choking on a pill on Christmas. My mother is hard of hearing and sometimes doesn't know when he's in trouble. It was a big scare because I've never seen him choke to the point of grasping and stamping his feet and slapping things desperately.<br /><br />Anyway, I just bought this and sent it to him. He was very thankful and read the directions several times and watched several videos on how to work it. There are two major problems why I am returning this. 1) it takes a LOT of strength to push the plunger down, which is not useful to the elderly or doing to oneself while struggling, and 2) it didn't work on him. My dad just called me and had a bout of choking on his pills again, and the device did not work. He said he felt a bit of suction, but it did not pull the pill out. So my guess is the LifeVac only works on certain foods and they have to be caught on certain parts of the throat. But it helped my dad zilch. Zero. Not for elderly folk who choke on pills.<br /><br />*UPDATE 2/23/21*<br />Bumping another star because customer service is great and attentive. But there are a lot of dangerous things I learned about this device that I think people should know. It was explained to me that the device is designed to work when the airway is ‚Äúfully‚Äù blocked. If my dad was unconscious, that would mean his airway was fully blocked. So the fact that my dad had to scramble to find a piece of food to ‚Äúswallow‚Äù to help get the pill down means that the airway was not ‚Äúfully‚Äù blocked‚Äîwhich customer service said was not a device failure. So take this with caution‚Äîlike I previously said, this device is only for certain kinds of choking. Sadly, the deadly kind, and I probably will not purchase again to verify. Another problem is that my dad had to use the LifeVac on himself. My mom is elderly too and about 80% deaf, so if she‚Äôs somewhere else in the house without her hearing aids or still asleep, she won‚Äôt know my dad is choking. From my understanding, LifeVac pretty much explained to me that the device works much better when another person uses it on the person choking. You also have to strongly press the mask down on the face so no air can come out, and have a rigid grip to push down and quickly pull up. My father tried this 3 times on himself to no avail, and my conclusion is this device is not intended for elderly people to use on themselves, which I feel should be a big disclaimer. A device that only works when someone else uses it on the choking victim is VERY different from a device that anybody can use. I live in a different city, so it‚Äôs just my dad and mom together. If the choking victim is alone, I don‚Äôt recommend they use this on themselves",B07L9MBLYP,Industrial_and_Scientific

4260,3.0,Good for A8 upgrade...with work.,"I purchased this board to upgrade a $160 A8. My son has a Reprap Prusa i3 which I bought for about $100 more.  The A8 was a great deal overall, but I like some features of the Reprap better including the rotary encoder on the lcd (I hate the pushbutton one) and the ability to upgrade the stepper drivers.  This board looks like the same form factor as the A8 board but matches it only in one dimension, so is not directly mountable as the original. Pros: 1- you can use the DRV8825's on x and y for smoother, quieter operation. 2- One less layer than the RAMPS setup. 3- There is no interference between stepper driver board modules as is generally the case for RAMPS boards. Cons: 1- The ribbon cable connectors are on backwards. Thanks to Skroy for the heads up on that otherwise I would have returned the board. I unsoldered and rotated the connectors. The correct orientation is with the &#34;notch&#34; of the receptacles facing away from the board. IF upgrading an A8 you will need to rework several of the connectors being very careful to wire correctly. Pay particular attention to the endstop wiring and stay away from Vcc. It would have been nice if there were a second receptacle for the second Z axis stepper as on the original A8 board. Instead of splicing the motors in parallel, I mounted another receptacle as shown in the attached picture and soldered bus wire jumpers in parallel. A8 users will also need to invert the logic for Y,Z and E0 in the config.h as well as change the default axis steps per unit for Z if using a lead screw instead of a threaded rod and also change the encoder direction when adding a 2004 LCD with rotary encoder. I'm deducting a star from the review for implying a package of two boards.  Two boards would be too good to be true at this price, but a kid might think that's what they are getting based on the description.

It is just supposed to be slipped over the tube and, somehow, stay in place.<br /><br />The bag that came with my 12 gal. unit was for 12(?) to 16 gal. and was a bit too big which didn't help. I contacted the seller to see if I was doing something wrong since the bag was simply sucked right off of the inlet tube. It seems the impeller doesn't know the difference between saw dust and a chunk of paper. Imagine that! What a dumb impeller!<br /><br />Anyway, I contacted the factory and they confirmed that there is no provision, unlike EVERY OTHER unit on the market, to retain the bag. I made note with them that, in my humble opinion, this is a really stupid design. They, of course had no further comment but, were nice enough to send me three 12 gal. bags which do seem to hold on a little longer. But, just to be sure, I installed a couple of clamps to retain the bag.<br /><br />I guess I was just surprised to see that such an elementary design element was, overlooked(?), or just ignored to save a buck.

4322,4.0,"Had high expectations, and the price was attractive but......","Had high expectations, and the price was attractive but run into issues.<br /><br />Lets start with the packaging being really nice with a window showing the type of spool enclosed in the box, so helps if you have a number of boxes to quickly look through without opening each.  The manufacturer does slap a printed label that describes the color of the spool enclosed on the outside of the box but unfortunately is inconsistent in the placement of those labels for each box.  I received 4 boxes and all have the labels slapped in different spots on the box and from one its missing altogether.<br /><br />As for the filament spool itself, this filament came in a vacuum sealed packaging with a silica pack.  The reel is solid and has a nice design.  The outside label is in a good spot to identify the product.  The filament PLA itself is more brittle than my other PLA spools from other manufacturers but the color is a nice brown.  However, there is a very sharp sheen as in the stock photos.<br /><br />Once loaded onto my 3D printer the first print at 210 degrees celsius clogged the nozzle and locked up the extruder.  Thinking that the clog was due the nozzle just having all junk from long print hours, I removed the old nozzle and installed a brand new one.  I print using mostly a 0.4mm nozzle for my needs and since I build 3D printers have parts easily available.<br /><br />Cleaned out the extruder and tried again.  The filament clogged again on the new nozzle.  I knew that now the filament was the issue.  Rechecked the grub gear and noticed that this filament slips on the grub gear and binds up in the nozzle.  Cleaned the nozzle a second time and also tried to readjust the motor and also the tightness of the grub gear.  This filament continued to slip after numerous readjustments and there was no good setting to push this filament through the nozzle.  It continued to slip and clogged a 3rd time.<br /><br />In the interest of time to avoid installing a new grub gear , I loaded the filament on another 3D printer that just recently I had replaced the gear on.<br />Again, on the second printer the issue recurred and this time, the filament clogged and had bound to the inner PTFE lining of this printer.<br /><br />After cleaning both Printer clogs, I really wanted this filament to work given the price, but unfortunately given the issues I experienced I cannot recommend this PLA filament to other 3D makers.  I have 3 other boxes in different colors from Century that I'm hesitant to use.  Maybe when I have some down time I will try the others and post an updated review.<br /><br />Updated review October 2017: Adding 3 stars for the customer service.  The company sent another reel to me for testing and really stands behind their products.  Unfortunately, maybe my luck but this reel had similar issues.  I isolated them to the Q&A process and shared the information back with the customer reps.  If you are looking for a low cost filament to print from, give this a try as I expect that this company will make changes accordingly and this could be a great buy in the foreseeable future.",B01JKF6UHC,Industrial_and_Scientific

4329,4.0,"Works well, but a little confusing","Right out of the box, this seems like a pretty easy to use device. I think this is what gets most people confused.<br /><br />With the included software, you can get a calibration going within a few minutes but it'll spit out really odd and completely incorrect colors. I had to run the calibration several times to get everything spot on, but it was because I misunderstood the device and software. During the initial calibration, I was confused as to what it wanted when it was asking for color temperature. After a little time playing with some of my monitor's settings, I realized it wanted me to set my monitor's color temperature to the same value the calibrator was using. As soon as I got it all set right, it calibrated all 3 of my monitors (different brand and different ages) and everything was spot on. At first they looked WAY too green, but after switching between the calibrated and uncalibrated profiles I realized I've been working with all my monitors being much too magenta.<br /><br />One of my concerns before buying the Spyder Pro was that I read other reviews that said it wouldn't for multiple monitors on a single graphics card. Two of my monitors are running off a single card and my third from a separate card. Works like a charm. I was also concerned when the software installation setup required me to enter a serial key that I wasn't going to also be able to use it on my laptop. It turns out the serial key is to register the Spyder Pro device itself. I installed the software on my laptop and calibrated it just like my desktop.<br /><br />I am a freelance VFX artist, so my work is incredibly color sensitive. Up until now I've been managing my colors based on the histogram, waveform, and vectorscope monitors within my compositing software. Now I can definitely rely on the image to show me the colors that are actually there.",B00WUIBS06,Industrial_and_Scientific

4336,4.0,Excellent 3D Printer with a Few Minor Issues,"This 3D Printer far exceeded my expectations, which were not very high given the price.<br /><br />My previous 3D Printer, the LongerWare Printer, was unusable. The software was only a nuisance and an unnecessary step, the micro USB slot was too big for the USB, so it would fall into the printer regularly, prints rarely worked or set properly, the build plate was terrible... all in all, I had a horrendous experience with that printer and sent it back.<br /><br />So, as you can expect, I was a bit hesitant to purchase this slightly-more-expensive resin printer, for fear of being scammed with terrible hardware, again. Fortunately, this was not the case. This printer is solid and well-built. The screen is easy to clean, the USB slot is properly sized, the prints come out perfectly (and quickly), and the instruction manual is simple to read. You don't have to use any extra software; ChiTuBox works fine on its own; no conversions are needed.<br /><br />My only complaint is that its difficult to sort files and my machine arrived with a slightly-wrinkled film on the resin tank (which turned out to also have a small tear). While the first matter is a software problem, I am currently in contact with ELEGOO trying to get a new resin tank to replace this broken one.<br /><br />I was, fortunately, able to get a couple of prints to come out when printing away from the area that has the wrinkles on the tank. These prints came out perfectly, were removed from the build plate easily, and set without issue using standard methods.<br /><br />So far, I would definitely recommend this printer. I am sure that once the resin tank is replaced, I'll be printing like nobody's business!<br /><br />==========<br /><br />For those curious, I use 3D Printing to create monsters/decor for a Dungeons and Dragons game that run. I had no problem getting small things to print in the non-wrinkled corner of the resin tank.

My last one wouldn't suck up the water unless you put a weight on the machine or pushed it down to actually get any suction which was had to do on a large machine. This one does a great job extracting the water from the carpet. Since it doesn't heat the water I raise the temp on my water heater to HOT a few hours before filling it and that helps.

4356,4.0,Hits the Mark!,"I just bought and used the Bissell Big Green Deep Cleaner. You will notice I gave this cleaner a 4* instead of a 5* unlike a lot of reviewers but this will be clear in just a moment as you read along.<br /><br />If you are reading this review, it is most likely you are considering purchasing a carpet cleaner. I owned a Hoover Carpet Cleaner for 10 years and it was time for me to get a new one. I was in Costco where I saw a good price on &#34;Bissell 1548 ProHeat 2X Revolution Pet Full-Size Carpet Cleaner&#34; and decided to get it. Bad idea - the suction was awful. So bottom line, if you want to get a carpet cleaner, spend the big bucks or else use the professional cleaners. Otherwise, a bad quality cleaner will likely make your carpets deteriorate faster than if you had not used a cleaner at all. Hence my decision to go with Bissell Big Green. Now for the still you have been waiting for. I evaluated this cleaner on 4 criteria:<br /><br />1) Suction: 5* Incredible suction. Does an awesome job in not only getting the bad stuff out but also the water.<br /><br />2) Ability to clean: 5* You will not be disappointed. I had a stain on my carpet that my previous cleaners were unable to get off. I pre-treated this stain with regular stain removal solution (used on clothes) and this bad boy got it out with no problem. I was impressed.<br /><br />3) Cleaning surface area: 4* This is where I docked a star. The problem I have here is that the front of the machine leaves almost 2 inches of area which is not cleaned if you hit a wall or any barrier. And about 1.5 inches on the left side. So while washing, you will have to make sure that you are using the right side of the machine along the walls to get as close to the side as possible and as far as the front is concerned, you will have to do those in a horizontal format.<br /><br />4) Maneuverability: 5* I decided to give this a 5 even though this is a very bulky machine. The reason for the 5 is because despite the construction of this cleaner is pretty solid, which probably requires some very heavy duty components, I could move the machine around fairly easily. I would rather have good quality components while sacrificing for a little bit of maneuverability. However, all in all it is not as bad as you may think of it as.<br /><br />5) Cleaning/Maintenance: 5* I found that cleaning the brushes etc. after my job was done was not painful. It pays to clean at least the bottom of the plate where brushes are installed, as you are most likely to encounter lot of fuzzies, etc.<br /><br />Other tips:<br />  I bought an extra tank for the clean water because I did not want to clean the tank of soap water or waste it, if I was in the middle of washing and I had more rooms to do. It is a personal preference and while to most this may not be a huge hindrance, I just saw it as an annoyance on my side since the machine does not offer a separate container for soap (which may be a bad idea since sometimes the soap nozzles tends to get clogged if you let it sit for a long time without flushing the nozzles).<br /><br />  Also, remember there is only one attachment that comes with this machine as a default. You will have to purchase extra accessories if you are interested in more directed cleaning.<br /><br />  Bottom line - go ahead and get it. It is worth the price and will last you long.<br /><br />Hope this helps.",B09H1BJW92,Industrial_and_Scientific

4359,4.0,"... this unit with my ""baseline"" unit Schiit Modi 2 Uber ($180). Will update you later","I am still comparing the sound quality of this unit with my &#34;baseline&#34; unit Schiit Modi 2 Uber ($180).  Will update you later.<br />So far so good.<br /><br />Oct-31-2015: So here is my subjective non-scientific results.  It has good sound quality - very comparable to Modi 2 Uber; with the same setting, this unit sound a bit louder than Modi 2 - not sure this is a considered a plus.  Good separation of sound; my source was .mp3 41Khz files; I also bought unit SMSL M6 32Bit/384KHz ($140), but what I like from this unit is that it has better instrument separation on one *.flac song that I audited.  Maybe SMSL M6 is &#34;overkilled&#34; for mp3 files or it does not have separate circuit for each sound sampling frequency?<br /><br />Here is a random infor. on ES9023 chip:<br />xxxx://xxx.head-fi.org/t/642750/is-peachtree-audio-going-to-less-expensive-dac-chips-in-their-latest-lower-end-offerings<br /><br />Not so good features and/or concern:<br />1. I don't like the sound from headphone plug of this unit - too metallic; plus there is no volume control, so this feature is useless!<br />2. This unit has 2 digital input sources; I don't know how this unit decides to pick which signal to process (if we play them both at once) - I need to test it<br />3. It's made in China - so let's see how long it will last<br />4. There is a scratch on the label of the AC-DC adapter - I don't like it - I might return it for this reason (see photo).<br />5. No USB.  No ON switch.  No input signal selection.<br />6. Warranty: I don't know who/where to call if this unit fails in future.  There is no manual/warranty card in English.  I might return it for this reason.<br /><br />Conclusion: If this unit does not break within 5 years, and if your source is mainly *.mp3 or digital output from TV, this is a good buy.",B00KL3S9UY,Industrial_and_Scientific

I‚Äôve found that though it is sticky, it will eventually lose its adhesiveness if not stuffed securely in a gap. Usually, some of it will fall off in winter as temperatures fluctuate.

4368,4.0,Not an aggressive exfoliater. Really a long wash cloth for your back.,"When I see the word &#34;exfoliate&#34; I have a more literal take. I imagine a somewhat abrasive surface to loosen and help remove the top layer of dead skin cells. This product is more of a long thin body cloth which is actually gentle. It accomplishes soaping up your back and shoulders pretty well. The ropes on the ends allow you to manipulate it across your back in difficult to reach areas. As such it works well. For actual exfoliating, a brush with a long handle is more effective and aggressive. Will need to see how well it holds up wet with all that tugging. But think of it as a washcloth not an exfoliate, that makes reaching your back easier and you should like it and find it effective.",B07SFS25TQ,Industrial_and_Scientific
4369,4.0,Great product and I'm looking for more ways to use it!,"I have to say that I haven't used this very much, so far.  I am not so thrilled that each packet is &#34;one time use&#34;, but it said that clearly in the product description so I should not be unhappy about it.  Each packet contains a small amount, although it was bigger than I expected.  About the size of a small walnut after it was all softened up. That's why I was not so thrilled.  I only needed about 1/2 a packet for my first use and that left the dilemma of whether to use only 1/2 and throw the other half away, or to use the entire amount.  In this case, I opted to use the entire amount because it really didn't make a difference.  I had purchased a new outdoor security light and it was supposed to have a small silicone plug to cover a screw hole.  The plug was to keep moisture out of the unit's electronics.  But there wasn't a plug.  I grabbed my Sugru, kneaded it a bit and then stuck the whole wad over the screw hole.  In the end, the largish wad of Sugru may make it easier to remove in the event I ever need to get to that screw again in the future.  And for now it is totally safe from rain and water getting under the Sugru.<br /><br />A completely non-issue is that the packets each contain a different color of Sugru.  The light's base is black, but I had no black Sugru.  I had red, green, blue, yellow and other colors, but no black or white.  I opted for &#34;Royal Blue&#34; and while it doesn't match the color of the light's base, it does what I want it to do and the color is a nice contrast to the black base color.<br /><br />As stated before, I put a blob of the Sugru over the hole in the light's base and let it sit for 24 hours.  When I went out to check later it was firmly attached to the light's base and didn't budge a bit when prodded.  There is more than enough of it to get a good grip should I ever need to try and pull it off.  I am only guessing that it isn't a totally permanent attachment, as I don't want to remove it unless I absolutely must.  Even if it is supposed to be permanent, I'm confident I can pry it off if needed because I could actually grab it with some pliers and forcibly tear it off if required.<br /><br />I like it and I'm sure I'll find plenty of ways to use it.  And whatever I fix or make with it, will be in bright, cheerful colors.  Take that plain old white glue!",B00WW8KIRI,Industrial_and_Scientific

I put it back together and filled the tank and flushed and it still leaked.<br /><br />I took it apart and looked closer and saw some very fine dark lines radiating out from one of the bolt holes. The toilet is probably twenty years old and might have had some vibration that cracked it.<br /><br />I bought this stuff and wiped the inside of the tank then waited for the inside of the tank to dry.<br /><br />It has a plunger with two tubes separating the two components and a nice resealable cap. I put on a pair disposable gloves and put a bead of glue on the bottom of the tank. I used my fingers to mix the glue and spread it around the bottom of the tank. I used almost all the glue.<br /><br />I let it dry over night to make sure it had set. Then I put the tank back on and filled the tank and flushed.

Have one for my own home and have purchased one for my daughter. Most important part of cleaning carpeting is to extract as much dirt as possible. I make 2 passes over an area while using solution. Then go over areas to remove all liquid. If the water is still dirty, the carpet needs more cleaning. Remove as much liquid from the carpet as possible before making another pass. When room is done, I repeat the procedure in the opposite direction with water and a slight amount of vinegar as a clean rinse to remove all chemicals and a disenfectant.<br />Periodically there are bad stains that need pretreating. For those we use a mixture of simple green, hot water and borax in a spray bottle 20 minutes ahead of time, then go over with the machine to remove all liquids before shampooing.<br />For pet urine, we use a pretreat of Odoban (kills the bacteria), and tepid water. (Need to do this a few times for cat urine) a d remove all liquid prior to shampooing.<br />We've tried them all... Professionals, Rug Doctor, just to name a few. The Big Green outdoes them all.

4463,5.0,Finally Figured Out the Key Settings to Printing PETG,"I let PETG get the best of me and I was never quite able to get a good, single, successful print but that has changed with this Overture brand of PETG in the Green Variety.  First of all you have to slow down your print speeds. Secondly you need to keep the nozzle closer to the bed than you'd normally have it with let's say PLA. Reason for the tighter tolerance between the nozzle and the bed is so that it will adhere much better. Slowing down your overall print speed to 30mm/s will absolutely help to adhere. The third item you need to look out for is your AC as in you air conditioner. Your AC can and will affect layer adhesion it really will. PETG is a an absolute bugger to print with so it requires special attention to the details. However once you have successfully printed with PETG the rewards in the strength and outdoor weather depts. are achieved. The very last item (the Fourth/4th) you need to pay special attention to is in the setings of your slicer (in this case we will use Cura as an example). The settings to look out for is ""Slow Down the First X Layers"" with X being your variable. So instead of slowing down the first ""2"" layers of your print please go on ahead change it to 6. This will (obviously) slow down the first 6 layers of your print which will enable the PETG to continue adhering despite its finnicky'ness not to. So let's recap what we went over but in a shorter, easier to digest ""bit"" of info:<br /><br />1)  Slow SLow Slow your Roll Amigo (40mm/s Max but realistically 30mm/s is a better number)<br />2)  Keep the Nozzle Close to the bed. Closer, much closer than you'd do with PLA which will aid in adhesion.<br />3)  Turn off the AC which will aid in adhesion it truly will.<br />4)  Slow down the first 6 layers (not 1 or 2 this will, again, aid in adhesion it really will).<br />5)  Use Elmer's Glue Sticks on the Hawkung brand (Blue colored removeable magnetic bed which is actually THE cheapest one on Amazon.com!!) Here is a link to suggested removeable magnetic bed:  https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07Y58ZG4B/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1<br />  NOTE: Be sure to wash, like literally wash off the magnetic bed, between EACH print and then smear down a good single layer of the Elmer's Glue Stick (Purple for each print)<br /><br />I kind of snuck in that last line #5 but hey at least I remembered!!!! Please pay attention to those 5 items listed above and you should be good with an emphasis on the word ""should"" cause there are so many freaking variables in 3d printing there really are..... Good Luck and Happy 3D Printing my fellow 3D Printerists!!!!!!!!!",B07PJ482SV,Industrial_and_Scientific

A picture of my settings is attached.<br />- The detail level is great.<br />- Cleaning with water was better than anticipated. In my wash station, the model was cleaned to about 90% clean in 6 minutes. I cheated afterwards and re-ran the cycle with IPA 70% but a brush and water probably would have been enough.<br />- The resin is almost water thin, which should allow for some tinkering on the between exposures time to decrease print time. I didn‚Äôt do it yet but it is still a positive.<br />What I disliked:<br />- It is a bit stinkier than other resins I use but not that much, so I didn‚Äôt even take a star.<br />Other thoughts:<br />I printed a known good model that I had done with other resins to have a known comparison point. While this one is almost identical to the other models I printed, this resin appears to be more brittle than the other ones I use.

That's how it is listed on Amazon.<br /><br />Now that the box is here (arrived timely and in good order), I see the brand is CP Shield.  Two stickers on the box indicate it is ASTM Level 3, but the box itself does not so indicate.  I could not find the Owner/operator number on the Internet.  Hmmn.  Anyway, the box was sealed with a sticker, and the masks themselves were in a plastic bag.  I like this as it keeps dust out.  Other boxes of masks I have open like a box of facial tissue.  This box does not.  It's a tad less convenient, but again it helps keep dust out.  I'm pleased with the packaging.<br /><br />The listing strongly implies the masks are sterile --  see fourth photo in the product listing --  but the box says they are NOT.  However, they do seems very clean.  Perhaps they are not sterile in the medical sense.<br /><br />I wore one today for several hours.  It was so easy to breathe, I got suspicious and cut one in half when I got home.  Yes, indeed, there are four layers -- thin layers.  Does it filter as well as described on Amazon?

I feel bad as I gave one to my wife and son so they would always have a light and they broke on all of us. First issue is that if you carry them on your keychain or in your pocket they unscrew by themselves an you will often find just the end dangling from your keys, this didn't bother me so much as I resolved just to wrap them with a piece of electrical tape to keep the little lights together. That alone would've been enough to give a 3 or 4 star review. But what really irks me is that the button broke on 3 out of the 5.

Initially, I really liked these lights.  They were in place for two weeks and then it rained.  The fixtures leak water--I guess through the solar panels on top.  The water gathers in the plastic cup that covers the LEDs. I am afraid that over time the inside will corrode and the fixture will stop functioning.  I could seal them with some silicone, but outdoor fixtures that cost almost $100 each should not leak from the getgo.  I am currently on the phone with Amazon Customer Service to see about getting replacements--wow what a pain--the language barrier between me a natural born English speaking American and obviously a foreign call center where English is not the primary language of the operator.<br /><br />So I am done with the call now--I think I am getting replacement lights and a return label to send these back if the operator understood and processed what I assumed we were talking about.

So, not sure what's up with these.  They were a good price and had the bits been sized better, it would have been a great deal.  I wish I had tried them when they arrived.

4657,2.0,"Cold rolls and no length for modern , NON SHAKER, drawers","These SEEM to be designed with shaker style in mind. I say this because a NON-Shaker drawer is 3/4 facing, 3/4 wooden enclosure and 1/16 inch raised bezel, for a total of either 1 1/2 or 1 5/8. A shaker will either be flush flat or recessed flat, for a TOTAL of 1"". Add in the 1"" ceramic bulb, the 1/16 cosmetic camber, and 2 washers and you get 2 3/4 TO the exit hole of the wood. meaning in 1 situation you have 1/16 left until your bolt exists and in another you are flush, and in both cases no ability to mount.<br /><br />So the concept is limited in what it can be addressed. The bolts NEED TO BE 3 Inch to cover all 6 styles of drawers made today. Not 2 1/2. So, while these work for any cabinet door, we are left hunting for 7 3"", concaved, flat surface, pull bolts......Not their fault, just their short sight, the fault is mine for not reading, but assuming.<br /><br />They are pretty, HOWEVER, and I know most will not know what these are, SEVERAL of these had cold rolls. A cold roll is a dimple or cavity caused by the material being compressed and separated as it rolls. These say handmade, but I think the term is being applied VERY liberally as I am sure these were made using a Miller machine from the 20s, hence the cold rolls. You can't get a cold roll from soemthing that is made by hand and never works down a spiral roller....you can only get this from a roller and when the room temp changes too much<br /><br />Anyway.<br /><br />They are pretty and inexpensive. Cheaper than their price at 2 other venues, so buy them here if you do. Just keep in mind, if you are using these on drawers that are not shaker or contemporary flat-panel farm, you will need a longer bolt, 3"" to have a protrusion to mount the nut to. Else you will have to bore 1/2 into one of your 3/4 pieces of wood in order to secure it. but, as I said, if you have a shaker ...you're fine...",B0BG35MMVS,Tools_and_Home_Improvement

Edge and heat treatment leaving much to be desired","Ordered this as a field knife, was really happy with the design and balance of the knife, handle is excellent, fits the hand well and grippy in all weather. Other reviews have mentioned the inconsistent secondary bevels on the blade edge and mine was no different. It came sharp but with about 3 different bevels ranging from 33¬∞ to 21¬∞ along the blade length.<br /><br />Major strong points: handle material/design, and the sheath. For a sheath on a 34 dollar knife I was impressed. Sturdy and retention is excellent<br /><br />Weak points: inconsistent bevels and grind lines, and after a month of use, I'm really disappointed in the quality of the sk5 steel and the heat treatment. This blade is soft as puppy crap. I reset the secondary bevel to 27.5¬∞ with a lansky system before taking it out for a week in the field, and it went from shaving sharp to dull as a stick in no time.

I wanted the pot filler and a sprayer and this was the only one I could find that had a long hose. I like the sprayer has two spray options.<br /><br />Cons: pot filler is only cold water and is only turned on by turning the head of the filler. The handle on the faucet only turns on the sprayer. The spray head is made of very cheap plastic. It‚Äôs not quality at all and at some point I might try to change it.

4741,3.0,Not really a big fan of design,"For $11.99 this is an okay set of utility knives but the set is really more show than quality, IMHO.  Things I liked:  The price, $11.99 for four folding utility knives is pretty good; a couple of the colors would be easy to spot if you couldn't find/dropped the knife.  I also like the belt clip on the back side of the knives.  It convenient and keeps a knife secure in you pocket.  Unfortunately that's about it for the good.  Here are the things I don't particularly like:  The case, it's cute but who uses a case for utility knives?  I have a drawer in one of my tool boxes that is exclusively used for utility knives and blades.  I'll either just toss the case or find some other use for it.  The knives themselves don't suit me very well.  They don't fit in my hand as well as most utility knives; they're short and I think would fit well in a small person's hand much better.  When I hold one of the knives in the open position, my index finger is perilously close to the blade and my thumb is next to the button that ejects the blade from the knife.  For me that's dangerous.  The knives have a very cheap feeling to 'em.  When one of the knives is in the open position, I can actually press the colored sides together so the tough each other.  That ain't good.  And when you open and close the knives (I tried it on 3 of the 4) the knives make a scrapping sound like something rubbing against something that it should not be rubbing against.  I'll use the knives since I ordered 'em but I wouldn't order them again.

4746,3.0,Fun While it Lasted,"This faucet worked well for one year until one day it abruptly wouldn't turn on. The faucet's potential downfall is its complex undersink design. Besides making the install more difficult (the guts take up more room under your sink), there are multiple small filter screens in a control box and a separate battery holder (six AA's) to run the motionsense.<br /><br />Up until the faucet stopped working, our only small nit during the year it did work was the motionsense side, which we didn't intentionally use very often. However it did activate whenever our hand or some other item passed that side of the faucet body when we weren't thinking about using that feature.<br /><br />We had no idea why it suddenly stopped working. A plumber cleaned the spray wand filter, which didn't solve the problem.  When he dismantled the control box, he found sand in the two of the four tiny, 10-hole filter screens. He couldn't get to the other two. When he reconnected everything, the faucet worked for about five minutes. Giving up, we had him uninstall that faucet and put in a simple, similar faucet without the gizmos. When he drained both the hot and cold lines before connecting them up, brown, sandy water came out. The new faucet is working fine.<br /><br />A word to those of you who live in Florida or other states with sandy soils. The plumber thinks sand got into our water lines from a break in a water main that services our area. When this happens, faucets with accessible screen filters can be cleaned out easily. This faucet cannot without a lot of work and plumber expense if you can't do the work yourself.",B083X61F4G,Tools_and_Home_Improvement

4777,3.0,Not sure these are genuine or not.,"I ordered these hesitantly because of all the fake stuff China is flooding our markets with. When I got them I looked at every detail and they appeared to be genuine 3M products. The box printing and paper quality matched other legitimate 3M products I purchased. The packaging style was consistent with 3M genuine respirators. The masks appear high quality although it is somewhat hard to believe they can achieve the N95 rating when compared to something like the 3M 8511 masks. The material is thin and flimsy feeling, they are however comfortable to wear.<br /><br />The ONE thing that has me questioning these were legitimate is the top of the box has text to refer to the instructions, but, ""instructions"" is spelled wrong. I really have a hard time believing 3M would let these out the door with a mis-spelling on the box. It's unfortunate that as a consumer I even need to question if these are real or fake and more unfortunate that the country sending all the fake stuff and stealing our products and IP is not held to account.",B08NTS51JX,Tools_and_Home_Improvement

4780,3.0,Initial Faucet Leaked,"After reading the many reviews for this faucet, I was expecting a well built quality product. I was aware of the complaints regarding the necessity of holding down the spray button in order to work the sprayer. That didn't bother me, since I don't ever find the need to walk away while using it. I, also saw that some had issues with the stability of the faucet once secured to the counter. I was installing the faucet onto a brand new granite counter-top, so I was a little worried about this. The hole was drilled and my fingers crossed!<br /><br />Upon initial instillation, I noticed some play, so I removed the faucet and tightened the base. This time there was no noticeable play. I hooked up the supplies, making sure not to kink the lines. I then followed the instructions to remove the cartridge and turn on the faucet for 1 minute. I immediately noticed some black grease like substance come out with the water. I assumed this was why they said to remove the cartridge first. After waiting the minute and not seeing any more foreign matter being discharged, I reinstalled the cartridge.<br /><br />Everything seemed fine, until I looked under the sink and saw that there was water coming from somewhere. Since everything was new, I assumed it was a p-trap leaking. Surprisingly, it wasn't. I then turned on the faucet and noticed water dripping straight down from where the base meets the counter. I removed the faucet again to get a better understanding of where the water was coming from. I saw that the source was inside the faucet, where there are no adjustments. I realized I had a defect! I went on Amazon and created a return/replacement order. I then went back and reinstalled it, since the leak was minimal, I could just throw some towels in the cabinet and live with it for a couple days.<br /><br />While I was waiting, the water pressure out reduced to almost a trickle. Hard to live with, but better than not having any water at all. I came back to Amazon and noticed that someone else had the exact same issue and reported it just a few days prior. I was now getting worried about a bad batch coming out of the factory. The date code on the box showed May 2016. I was happy to see the replacement, which was received on time in two days, showed July 2016. Amazon is wonderful with their returns. I would give them 5 stars!<br /><br />Installing the replacement was very easy, since I just went through the process a couple days before. I tightened the base securely, after learning my lesson with the first install. I immediately noticed that there was no grease like foreign matter coming out of the faucet upon initial flushing. I completed the install and ran the faucet for several more minutes. No leaks! Also, the base is holding well, so no play, either. If I would have received the replacement unit first, this would have been a 5 start review. I just don't feel right ignoring my initial defective unit, so 3 stars is all I can give.<br /><br />For anyone considering this faucet, it seems to be made well and quality built, as my initial expectations for it were. I realize nothing is perfect and defects can slip through the cracks. It's only been four days since the replacement has been installed and working, so I'll update this review if anything changes. It is really beautiful!",B014KE5O3Y,Tools_and_Home_Improvement

For some reason it says do not recoat so the spot that I did my initial test area was now double coated and looked completely different that the rest of the ceiling. In the end I had to repaint the whole ceiling white as this wasn't working out. I should also mention that this paint had like a semigloss level of sheen so if painting a wall make sure it's complete smooth or you will notice all imperfections.

4782,3.0,Not exactly like an incandescent,"LED's save energy, don't have to warm up, blah blah blah. Let's all be honest here and admit that this LED does not look identical to an incandescent. Often they have harsher shadowing and they are not good at showing deep red colors, like the natural red blush on your cheek bones. This makes people look pale. If you're mixing these with other bulb types or natural light, it will be less noticeable. Energy star certification only requires a cri of 80 so that's what most manufacturers produce. Incandescents have a CRI of 100 meaning that all colors are true to color under Incandescents. There are led's with high CRI, but for a CRI of 90+ you are going to have to pay $50+ for an r20 bulb, and they are super hard to find.

4794,3.0,"A lightweight, durable BIRD'S NEST","I'm a remodel carpenter. I've owned one of these hoses for 5 years, and it gets used whenever I do trim carpentry. It's very lightweight, and seemingly indestructible. Even an accidental encounter with some carpet tackstrip didn't puncture it.<br /><br />If you unroll it completely, and carefully lay it out on the floor, it will remain relatively tangle free. Its small diameter allows it to easily slip beneath a closed door, unlike my other, thick rubber hoses. (great for nailing the casing on the other side of a closed door, without having to move the compressor into the same room.)<br /><br />This hose is super flexible. Maybe TOO flexible. Although it unrolls more easily than a thicker rubber hose, especially in cold weather, the 50 foot long PUR hose wants to re-coil itself so badly that it tangles as easily as a 100 foot long, 16 gauge extension cord. Rolling this thing up at the end of the day can make you forget about how light and thin it is, and might cause you to regret spending the extra money on a hose that you probably can't kill, yet might want to give away, if you can untangle it from your feet. I strongly recommend a cord wheel, to try to maintain control of this skinny snake.<br /><br />Many purchasers of the PUR hose seem to either love it or hate it. I guess I'm somewhere in between.

It worked great, clearly made the water feel different (significantly), and I like that it has ""vibrational"" designs and thought put into it -- the frequency of this one vs. a cheaply made version carries some weight, if that matters to you.<br /><br />The design of this one really helps -- I'm a 6'4"" guy, so dropping the shower head 6 inches really isn't an option for me, lol.<br /><br />The first one I had did burst, eventually, after about 2 years of use -- hairline crack, right by the outlet. I'm a handy guy, so I used expoxy and fixed it right up -- lasted another year, until my landlord replaced the shower and threw it out. So I got another one. Then I moved out, and didn't use a filter for awhile, gave the old one away or something, but now I'm back for another!<br /><br />After doing a bit of research on what filters are out there, and what pricing, it seems that ""similar"" filters can be had for around $60 -- the design, the size, and just carbon/basic filtering.

4816,4.0,"Clog Bazooka, for the stubborn ones","I'm just going to call this the clog bazooka because that's pretty much what it is. It got rid of a pesky clog I had that ate 2 pipe snakes due to tight bends in the pipe. I used a 25 ft snake and got it past the kinks in the pipe only to find that my clog was further in than 25 ft so I got a 50 ft snake that died before I could get it past 6 inches. I even tried drain cleaner to no affect. So I picked up this clog bazooka and went to work. 25 ft of water in a pipe that's 1 1/4"" is a lot of water weight to have to move through a pipe on top of trying to get it past a clog. That comes out to roughly 1 1/2 gallons of water weighing 12 lbs. That's a lot of mass, especially for a plunger. But after one blast I was able to get it to at least drain a little however slowly it was, it was still better than nothing so I started running straight hot water figuring that the clog had to be made up of solidified cheese (my room mate is a disgusting cheese freak and puts it on everything and then washes the remains in the sink along with all the grease from his deep fried food). The drain would fill up so I would hit it again with the clog bazooka. More hot water, more bazooka, more hot water, more bazooka. Then the cheap mini bike pump that came with it died on me since I had to have been pumping this thing into the red every time, likely 80psi or so. I grabbed my air compressor and continued going at it. Finally after hitting the sink about 15 times with this thing it is draining properly once again. This is the only thing that could have possibly solved my problem outside of hiring a plumber to redo my whole drain pipe situation for likely no less than $5K.<br /><br />As a side note, if there is water above the nozzle of the clog bazooka, it WILL go everywhere. No matter how hard you press to keep the air pressure in the drain and below the nozzle, you WILL get wet. I suggest you engage safety squints and turn away. If you have ratty cloths, now is the time to wear them.<br /><br />5 stars initial review because this thing saved me a lot of headache, downgraded to 4 due to the cruddy bike pump thing that's included. I really want to give a 4.5 but that isnt an option and I dont think the pump should drag it down that far. It is included in the purchase after all which is good. They could have just left you high and dry so you would have to find something to use yourself so they have my high marks there. Gotta save cost somewhere.<br /><br />Overall I am very happy with this purchase and I recommend it to anyone with a super stubborn clog.",B0BLZCT83W,Tools_and_Home_Improvement

As other people wrote here, you should to prepare new batteries and follow the steps very carefully. I needed to close the battery lid to succeed the ste (and it wasn't directed in the instruction, but some YouTube videos do so, then I tried).<br /><br />Also there is note to install multiple locks. You need ""myQ Chamberlain Smart Garage Control"" for each lock. It's unbeliebable, but yes.<br /><br />I tried to install two locks for the garage door and the main entrance. I've previous installed smart garage controller that works with myQ app, so we also have a hub that allows accessing them through the Internet. My original plan was to controll all locks through the hub. However, when I complete the installation of the 2nd lock, the 1st lock lost connection with the hub. The screenshot indicate that. I retried entire pairng steps with the 1st lock, then the 2nd lock lost the connection with the hub. Yes you need the hub for each lock to control them through the Internet, I confirmed that with their onlien support.

It's great for finishing work, or even driving the occasional drywall screws because you don't have to worry it's not strong enough to blow right through.  The quality of the CXS is outstanding and the ergonomics is excellent.  I find myself reaching for this drill most times because it's easy to hold and is made so well..

So, OK, we are using a 40-watt bulb and for a bedside lamp it is OK. But description should match the item.<br />The hardware to mount the lamp is weak. The inserts for the drywall don't grab properly and instead spin and slip into the wall. Save the trouble and use some good quality ones. I was able to install the lamp with two of the four mounting points going into a stud, using my own screws, which made a solid connection for the base part. The lamp itself attaches to the base with two tiny machine screws -- very weak and a bit wobbly. They should use four screws for that and then have a stronger connection and no wobble.<br /><br />I recommend the lamp, but know you will use a lower wattage bulb and might have to take more care with the installation / hardware.",B0B3SKZ1RR,Tools_and_Home_Improvement

I tried it with the receiver roughly 70 feet away and through 4 walls just for fun. It worked just as well as 17 feet and 1 wall. The likely problem you may have is finding an unused electrical socket to plug in the receiver. Fortunately, my living room has few electronic gadgets (unlike the rest of the house). Now for the minor drawbacks. It is kind of cool that it as 38 different ringtones, but come on! This is not a phone! The tone that first played was fine, but I had to try some of the others. There is a button on the receiver that steps to the next tone. My advice is if you find one that you like, stop right there! Otherwise, you will have to step through all 38 to get back to that one. Some of the ""tones"" are close to a full song verse and way too long for a doorbell chime. When you choose the spot to place the transmitter button, make sure you are happy with it because once the button is snapped on to the mounting plate there is no easy way to separate them.

Like others, you've got to be careful with the template and only remove when you are fully out of the template.  I accidentally nicked mine, but not at the top, so the bushing still works with the template.<br /><br />Also, be wary of the cheap and ill-constructed 8mm collet reducer included.

4911,5.0,Crafters: this case isn't just for handy-persons!,"I am an avid arts & crafts person - crochet, knitting, beading, etc., and I was trying to find a way to organize all my little notions & odds and ends. For years, I've been using small cases: pencil cases, boxes, ziptop bags, to hold my stuff. I could never find my stuff, and had to re-buy items, only to find it at the bottom of my craft stash after my project was done! If you can find a decent organizer at a crafts store, they're using really small and expensive. No one wants to spent upwards to $150 for a poorly constructed arts caddy, even if it's got pretty decorations on it! I stumbled onto this case through another search, and thought I would try it. Worst case scenario, we can put our extra tools in it! I was so pleased with the construction of this tool case - strong canvas, solid straps, plenty of pockets and loops that can hold scissors without the fear of poking through and damaging the case. There's quite a bit of room in here without being overly cumbersome, The organizer in the middle is of much higher quality than the crummy ones you get at the crafts store, and are great for little pieces you've collected but don't know how to store. It's also a great way to transport your stuff if you belong to crafting meetup groups. I brought this case with me recently and so many of my fellow crafters love the idea and are planning on getting cases for themselves! Bottom line: great organizer for your craft items, and although it's just plain black, I'm sure that resourceful crafters can personalize it with fabric paints, embellishments, appliques, etc. Personally, I like it how it is, and want to let my fellow crafters know that this is an alternative to the overpriced junk you might find at your local craft store!",B0B3VL7K68,Tools_and_Home_Improvement

The power button, light brightness switch and the control board are all perfect. The LED light kit was gorgeously sleeved and reveals only the LED bulb. Molex adapter seemed very well made also, no flabby connector is a good connector ehh?<br /><br />Everything worked as expected (you do need to connect it from a molex power, as in don't connect your power to a control panel, then have it route 3 or 4 small adapter out, that won't work because not enough power is distrubuted, I tried it and almost thought my kit was defective).<br /><br />The power button on the back is easy to press, button is responsive.

I've hit the cutting blade a few times by trying to get the very last slice from a vegetable.  These gloves have a metal lining and keeps the blade from penetrating.  You'd think that these glove, being stitched with metal, would be unyielding and uncomfortable; just the opposite.  A very good product, one which will keep our mandolin blade from being nicked.

Well, this attached perfectly and I had the strongest flow of water, three different settings, and I couldn't be happier. Only thing is there's no shut off. So, to conserve the hot water from our small 6 gallon heater, I have to shut the valves off completely and readjust the hot and cold each time.

If you have rotted wood, this product is a godsend.  simply chip out some wood, brush on the hardener which works as a primer for the woodepox and then add the woodepox, shape, let it dry and sand.  No shrinkage whatsoever and dries rock solid.  We were so impressed with it, we repaired parts of our deck with it, and some sanding, and it's as good as new.  we spent about $200 compared to $4000 it would have cost the carpenter to replace and fix.",B0BLLGWSMD,Tools_and_Home_Improvement
4964,5.0,Instruction are..... ehhhh....,"I tried to follow the instructions but common sense kicked in.  But, once I got past that, the product works great.  I have them installed on my spa room door.  Talk about smooth.  The only thing is the guide they supplied.  Kinda worthless.  Unless you have a router and want to take the time to use it an put a slot in the bottom of the door.  I ended up using a couple ""L""  aluminum channels to create a slide.  Works great.<br /><br />Recommend, yes.",B09M2H3DN4,Tools_and_Home_Improvement
4965,5.0,Works Great for My 240 Volt Workshop Heater!,"I bought this for a 240V workshop heater (two 120V hot wires).  Works great, and the bright red light reminds me to turn off the heater when I leave.  This switch is more expensive than a regular one, but I would spend more on electricity by leaving the heater on overnight a few times (or burning down my workshop!).  Love this switch.",B003AUGG4G,Tools_and_Home_Improvement

4971,5.0,"Before my counters were a sad, wooden","I purchased this counter top paint kit in May 2015 but I wanted to see how well it held up before I reviewed it. Before my counters were a sad, wooden, painted board but now they look beautiful! This process was easy enough, it was just time consuming...very time consuming. I read and reread each step so that I knew everything before I started. This kit comes with a DVD so I watched the video several times as well. I would really recommend reading and watching the instructions before starting.<br />I would really recommend sanding down your counters if you notice any bumps or gashes. There are a couple of small chipped areas on my counters but its only on the spots were I didn't sand enough.<br />Also, take breaks and practice on the paper provided, it made me feel more comfortable when sponging.<br />I noticed some people had issues with the top coat. You roll it on quickly but don't stress about it! If you go over wet spots it does start to look milky but that goes away when it dries. I put the top coat on several times just in case I missed a spot.<br /><br />First Photo: Before<br />2nd Photo: Black Primer<br />3rd Photo: After!",B07BJ4LKXF,Tools_and_Home_Improvement

4996,5.0,"Works great on the Roof, Fascia, or Wall","I originally purchased this so I could clean out my gutters easier by having the arm rest on the roof. It does a fantastic job of that (provided your roof Pitch is steep enough); but has also excelled on the Fascia of my Parent's house since they have a very shallow roof. It allowed the ladder to be more stable and not damage the edge/drip edge of the shingles as well. I take it off for storage, but that's no big deal as it's very easy to attach and detach. It only takes a minute or two to put it back on when needed and makes storing the ladder much easier.",B09438LJHN,Tools_and_Home_Improvement

4998,5.0,Great Lights!,"When you order a quantity of 1, you get 1 box containing 2 complete lights.  The lights come with everything you need.  Instructions are clear and easy to follow (with pictures).  The lights can be configured to operate in any combination of the following:<br />On/Off Button: one click = orange lights, click again = bluish white lights, click again = lights off<br />Mode Button: low light level always on, one click = low light level with motion detection (when motion is detected, low light level temporarily becomes bright light level), click again = bright light level always on, click again = back to first mode<br /><br />The lights and solar panel are each independently adjustable within 1 plane (I hope you know geometry).  They do not swivel on a ball joint.  Each light contains a lithium ion rechargeable battery.  During the day, the solar panel recharges the battery.  At night, the lights run off of the battery.  At low light level, the lights last the entire night until dawn.  I don't know the performance of the other 2 modes.  Lights can be mounted on any surface, vertical or horizontal, concrete, brick, plastic or wood.  If you prefer, they come with a stake for installing directly into the ground without any tools.<br /><br />These lights are very well designed and are of excellent quality.  They are rain-proof.  i really like them a lot and recommend them to anybody.  Best bang for your buck.",B07FNQCQ6F,Tools_and_Home_Improvement
